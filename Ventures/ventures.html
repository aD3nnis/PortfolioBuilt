                I am currently still working on this tab but the tab still exists on my original Wix website.
                Feel free to check out any other content on that website as well and see the changes I have made
                from that website to integrating to this one!

                This is a link to a website that I have built for a client called forever tropical.
                I used a template but changed some of the liquid code to fit the needs for the website. An example
               is having a video play on loop on the hero page.
