                   I wanted to create an online space that not only showcases the products but also conveys a sense of contemporary sophistication.
               </p>
               <p>    
                   To achieve this, I've incorporated earthy tones and design elements that resonate with a refined, organic sensibility that complements the brand aesthetic.

                This is a carousel that I would use to shift through 
                the products based off collections. This can be done 
                in a couple ways but this is a great way to show off 
                all the types of products you have                </div>
            <div class ="descriptPar">   
                Here I would add some photos if possible of giving back to the community or just photos that represent that. But I also like demonstrating your logo to show how you spread like leaves to many different areas and help the community. </div>

               This is a link to a website that I have built for a client called forever tropical.
               I used a template but changed some of the liquid code to fit the needs for the website. An example
               is having a video play on loop on the hero page.
