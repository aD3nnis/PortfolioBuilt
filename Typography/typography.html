            <h1>Typography Projects</h1>
            <p> These projects were made for my typography class where we explored how to use the shape of text to
                experiment with different emotional appeals.</p>

            <p class="description2"> I will describe this final draft with how it makes me feel.
                From the fun and colorful life of the fantasy world we are
                met at a point in the depth of the narrative. In each well told
                story we can read between the lines to see what is hidden in the shadows.
                But it is just a story, nothing is real but the lie that fiction tells.
                However, the vibrant colors on stage shed light into the black and white of good and evil. If we look
                closley enough we will find truth in the white of the lie. Coming to the realization that fantasy at its
                best is in unison with reality makes the story worth watching which is any artists hope for their piece.

            <p class="description"> This project is one of my favorties. The point of it was to represent scale in the
                shape.
                If you look at the letters in the middle you can see the "X w Y m v" extending out on both sides.
                What is cool about it is you can see the physical letters in white (X Y v) get smaller as you go
                outward.
                However, If you look at the tops of those letters it looks like a bunch of v's side by side which don't
                change size.
                That is just one example of whats going on within this piece. </p>
            <p class="description"> This project came to mind when us students were given the task of making letters
                seem playful.
                which I think this design conveys that really well. My thinking was to use only letters to make a
                playground and use
                all capital letters only. However, with the letters representing children on a playground are all
                lowercase.
                I thought that symbolisim of adults being the foundation and "bigger letters" while the children are the
                playful and colorful
                "little letters" was an interesting concept and I am happy with how it turned out. </p>

            <p class="description2"> This is Doja cat made out of a bunch of phrases that she has said in her songs. What
                I hope a veiwer thinks when viewing this is "Wow alot is going on here!".
                I think how creative Doja cat is with her music is what I tried to express
                through her hair and her face. I think the spunk this image creates is the same
                vibe that Doja Cat gives off herself.</p>
