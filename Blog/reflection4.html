        <h4>
            Friday Discussion
        </h4>
    <p>

        My reflection is based on what was discussed on Friday this week, which included three different presentations. </p>
        
        <h4> Presentation on Dress to Impress</h4> 
        <p> first was a presentation on Dress to Impress, a fashion game on Roblox.
        
        In the game, you get to choose your avatar and have access to a variety of clothing items, with many patterns and textures. There is a grading scale that ranges from 1 to 5 stars, and you can progress to become a top model. The game offers a lot of themes, allowing for diverse representations of styles. It's cool to see different cultures or approaches to styles that you can choose from.
        
        You can customize your avatar’s skin color and choose different hairstyles, with pop culture influences such as horror movies also being represented. In the game, you have to walk around and find different items to add to your outfit. I asked about the animation, and interestingly, the animation style for women is similar to that of men, which is surprising because it appears to be a very feminine walking style.
        
        You can rate other players based on how well their outfits fit the theme and if you like their costume. The theme discussed during the presentation was Hollywood, and in that fashion show someone dressed entirely in white, claiming they were “powder.” The presenters point was that the creator of the game was a 17-year-old, making it difficult to ensure that the game remains free of cultural disrespect.
        
        The cultural impact of the game is significant, as many themes and outfits are influenced by current trends. This game has great potential, especially for design students who can experiment with different colors and clothing. It's also a great way to express personal preferences. Expression and culture are important, and how we present ourselves is significant to each individual, which is why this game is meaningful to those who play it. It allows players to showcase their knowledge and background for others to see.
        
        I am curious about how the voting system works and whether it could be detrimental to players. The answer to this question was that the player base includes very young children as well as teens, creating a wide gap in understanding the themes or the message players are trying to convey. A possible solution could be to separate players by age, but regulating the game in this way is difficult. The positive aspect is that this game could help bridge the gap for women entering the gaming world.
        
        Closing thought was to pay attention to how we express ourselves.
        
    </p>
    <h4> Presentation on Books</h4>  
    <p>
        
        The third presentation was on creative writing, focusing on Plato’s ideas. The speaker expressed a dislike for Tolkien’s writing and discussed creativity in literature. Reading, according to him, expands the mind. Video games and movies are examples of technological creative writing, as they convey experiences and ideas in a narrative form. Isn’t coding also a type of creative writing, as it presents what people want to see? 
        
        The speaker raised the question of what defines creative writing. Should it always have a narrative? He suggested that creativity informs technology, with creative writers imagining things that aren’t real, but they influence technologists.
        
        At one point, he made a pitch for UX and UI, emphasizing that both are important, though he prefers creative writing. The presenter argued that creations from different cultures inform others about diverse perspectives.
        
        He pondered whether creative writing is more effective through technology or analogous methods. Sometimes creative writing might seem meaningless, but it reflects the world around us. Often, it expresses fears for the future and technology. For example, many people fear that AI will destroy the world, and we should consider why people feel that way.
        
        The speaker surveyed people about a book and examined what emotions were evoked, making it difficult to quantify responses. He suggested looking at trends over time to understand the emotional reactions to things. Creative writers often imagine what is beyond the realm of possibility, but he emphasized that technology and creative writing should mutually inform each other.
        
    </p>
        <h4>The Analysis of Twitter Data</h4> 
    <p>
        
        This  presentation compared Twitter data to climate change. Environmental changes, such as hurricanes and storms, are happening worldwide, and Twitter provides real-time insights into these events. Social media plays a key role in driving conversations about environmental issues.
        
        Sentiment analysis involves evaluating emotional states, such as happiness, anger, or depression. Twitter’s API allows for data collection over a period, where extraneous characters, URLs, or emotions are filtered out. Tweets are then categorized as positive or negative based on their content.
        
        According to the analysis, positive tweets make up about 30%, negative tweets around 45%, and roughly 25% are neutral. The presentation highlighted how people feel about climate change, noting that a significant portion of tweets expresses denial or negative sentiment toward climate change.
        
        What was also discussed was trends on Twitter. When something trends, it shows up on your “For You” page. For instance, the presenters own feed is filled with sports-related content. Twitter also shows which cities or states are affected by natural disasters.
        
        The presentation touched on the positive mentions of climate change by Greta Thunberg, while older generations tend to be negative, focusing on concerns such as the economic impact of transitioning to green energy or potential job losses.
        
        What was also showed was a video of Greta Thunberg from 2018, which I didn’t find particularly useful for the presentation. And that is because it was an 11 minute video so I think only playing the first 30 seconds of it did not get to the message of what Greta was talking about. I also don’t really see how that relates to twitter. I don’t understand what us as the audience understanding her stance on climate change has to do with twitter analysis. It’s good to know if she is positive or negative because she is an influence but playing a video on her stance doesn’t show how that correlates with twitter analysis. 
        
        Sentiment refers to attitudes expressed on Twitter, and distribution patterns are linked to machine learning. However, sentiment analysis isn’t directly displayed on Twitter itself. I had a lot of observations that came from this experience. Frankly, this presentation was all over the place. I don’t know this person so I am making assumptions but I would assume that they copied and pasted text from articles and put them on their slides. This is because they were talking about how they didn’t mean to put “green energy” as apart of the economic impact slide. But that isn’t a grammatical error. It would have made sense if they said “oh I put an extra ‘the’ in there my bad” but putting in a whole extra idea by accident shows you just copied and pasted something.
        
              </p>
        <p>
            I overall found this presentation pretty enjoyable in a way that was maybe not intended. Life is so funny sometimes, I get so stressed about how I present and it being perfect that I create loop of those anxious emotions to keep me on track but this presentation was very different from that. And maybe this presentation was very different from how I would present and that is why I learned so much from watching it. I have been trying to work on having an open mind and learn something from every experience that I encounter. From this experience, I realized that everyone approaches preparation differently. It seemed to me that the presentation could have benefited from a bit more preparation, as there were moments that suggested uncertainty. For instance, there were several times when the presenter read from the slides but paused because they seemed unsure of what was in their own presentation. There was also a moment when they mentioned including a graph unrelated to the topic by accident. I personally do my best to avoid these situations, so it's something I find a bit challenging to understand.
        
            However there is so much that I don’t understand and I am learning that the more I try to understand why professors teach the way they teach the less I actually know about teaching. I haven't conducted any interviews yet but I am just observing that when I ask about attendance, policy, or technology in a classroom the more I feel conflicted with my own feelings on the matter. For example here is a message that. I sent to a professor asking for insight and an attached image: 
            
            

            </p>
            <p>
            Hey, 
            
            I remembered that Dr. Rodgers had brought up "what does blackboard show you when you are not doing well in a class?" and well I have a screenshot of that, and I figured you would be interested in seeing it. 
            
             
            
            Couple things to note: 
            
            I took out the class name cause I'm not here to throw shade on the professor, but I am here to throw shade on policy. 
            
            If you click the button "view my activity" in what I circled in red on the left you get the pop up window on the right.
            
            What problems I have with this: 
            
            I have a 74% in this class, I have 0 missed assignments so why is my score so low? Attendance. I had told this professor I would be gone for a school event, and I still got marked down for attendance. I also overheard from the same professor that students in sports who are gone for school sports still get marked down if absent from class. In my personal opinion this is unfair but I am curious, as a professor yourself, what do you think of this policy?
            
             
            
            I know I am throwing the word "unfair" out there with this policy but there is an argument that some could state, "life is unfair, just deal with it". And I just don't know if I agree with that in this context. Thoughts? 
            
             
            
            Besides the policy possibly being unfair what is even worse is what Blackboard shows you stating that "your grade is low compared to the class average". Logically I understand attendance is a small percentage of the overall grade but I consciously jump to the conclusion that I am doing bad in this class even though I am aware of the future reality that this is not be a big deal. My concern is that this is an unnecessary stress added with an unfair policy that leads to a disinterest in the course. 
            
             
            
            If you find time, I would appreciate your overall thoughts on this. Relating to this new information would you do anything differently with your class? Do you think that professors should all have the same attendance policy? What attendance policy makes the most sense to you? Would you enter grades in differently? 
            
            If you don't have time to respond I understand, I'll just bug you at your office hours sometime about it. I appreciate your insight. Thanks!
            
             
            
            </p>
            <p>
        
            
            And here was the response: 

             
            

             
            

      
        </p> 
        <p>
            
            Hey Ava!
            
            My first reaction is “Want to boost your grade?” is such a dubious question. As you are pointing out your autonomy in this grade is limited by professor policy, and thus you can’t do much about it. So this question is begging the action of ‘Do something’ but really in this instance it is ‘Ahhhhh, I can’t do something.’ It also pushes an unhelpful narrative that poor performance in class is directly correlated with effort (i.e. if you have a poor grade, you are just not doing the right ‘things’) which is not always true.
            
             
            
            Ok, your questions:
            
            At an institutional level we don’t have a unified policy on this. We are working on it (this semester there is a draft policy being discussed). So without the larger policy in place: this is hard. On one hand, I do get the argument ‘be in class.’ Digital Humanities is a good example. The conversation on Wednesday with Dr. Hitefield was excellent. The reason I want that is to give students exposure. If you are not there, you don’t get that exposure. Your appropriate response to that would be ‘But isn’t the career trek a good use of time?’ and my answer would be ‘Yes!’ So the issue is that was have divergent priorities of ‘good’ activities.
            
             
            
            Another aligning perspective that I deal with all of the time: athletes who are also lazy. Now, ‘lazy’ is a hard word to apply here, that is not really what I mean. But I have had lots of students who are in athletics, so there is an assumption of professorial support, but they push this professorial support into I-am-a-college-student-and-would-like-to-not-be-in-class type territory. I fielded an email from a student who wanted to be excused from a Monday class just because they got back late on Sunday. Not because they couldn’t be in class, they just didn’t want to participate after a day of travel. How do we address this? I don’t know, not well!
            
        <p>
            In your instance, I would have a rational conversation about expectations. Don’t make it about complaining, but still make sure you understand the policy, and make sure the professor understands where you are coming from.
            
             
            
            As an aside, I would argue a career trek is far more valuable to student learning (what we are trying to do here) than an athletic trip.
            
             
            
            Life is Unfair: maybe a different way to re-frame would be ‘life is full of choices and consequences.’ This is similar to my ‘I am sick’ test policy. Unless you have a medical reason you cannot be present to take an exam, you need to take the exam. I don’t get a pass if I am sick. My deadlines and responsibilities don’t change if I have a cold. Part of this is tied to thresholds. Each person’s threshold for ‘I am sick’ is different. This gets even more dubious when there is an incentive to be sick (i.e. more time to study, the ability to talk to someone else in class, spreading out a busy week).
            
            In this case, the rules are set. You can disagree with them, but ultimately the consequences are there. It sounds like ‘don’t show up for class, don’t get credit.’ You know how I feel about grades, but in this case I would say: “cool, I will get a poor grade in this class then” I see why you would say that is unfair. I don’t think you are wrong, but also the argument does not land that hard on our side.
            
             
            
            Yes, the way Blackboard is doing this (partially because the poor ways we understand what Blackboard is doing) is unhelpful. It is good intention (early intervention) masked behind a bad implementation. Also that ‘What can I do?’ segment is just wrong. It is generic, but not accurate or authentic. Your disinterest is understandable, as you have pointed out: when students are frustrated, being told ‘Do better’ or ‘Keep it up’ is not really effective.
            
        </p>
        <p>
            This conversation makes me want to hide all grades from students. I know students dislike my strategy on this, but this is a great example of how the opposite can go really poorly. If it were up to me: I would have an even stricter attendance policy. I am teaching students how to master my course’s content, not recreate in different areas under the pretext of ‘athletics.’ I know that is an extreme position (and I know you have nuanced and long thoughts on college athletics). Athletics should always come secondary to academics. Forcing academics to cater to athletics is unhelpful in the context of what we are trying to do. I don’t think your resume is based on your time playing Basketball, I think it is based on the skills and experiences you had in the classroom.
            
            This does not address your specific situation, where you were doing a curricular aligned out-of-class experience. In this case, I would only recommend this for students who are otherwise doing well in their classes. In that case, missing some points for being absent will not matter. For students who it would matter, they probably should be in class.

        <p>
            Overall, there is a lot that I agree with what this professor is saying. I think that I can be harsh because I am emotionally invested since these are my own grades that we are discussing so I can be very biased in my approach. I think maybe what is most important that I gather from this conversation is that nothing is black and white. There is intention behind everything and what is important for the individual is understanding their own needs and being able to address those needs in an appropriate way so that others can respect those needs.
