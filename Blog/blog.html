                    Reflection 1: What are you excited about doing in this space?
                </h3>
                <p> I am excited in the freedom to create in the space I have been working 
                    on all throughout college. I am very thrilled when I feel like what I am doing
                    has a purpose and I can visually see the progress. I also like figuring out the connection
                    people have with the digital space and understanding the importance of data from that connection. 
                    I have been in this field for a while so I am already coming up with ideas
                    on how I can make this class experience tailored to me.  
                </p>

                    Why is it interesting to you?
                </li>
                <p>
                    This topic interested me because it is relevant to what most of us care about. 
                    We are told that we should go to college to get a degree so we can get a higher paying job. 
                    But if you look at this chart it shows that some majors are not really worth it. 
                </p>
                <li>
                    Where did the source data come from?
                </li>
                <p>
                    <a href="https://www.collegenpv.com/" class="animated-link" target="_blank">CollegeNPV</a> 
                    is a independent company that conductsanalysis of expected 
                    financial outcomes of universities. 
                    This information is useful for typical entering students interested in college.
                    The calculations of the data are estimates based on
                    publicly available data from the U.S. Department of Education and 
                    Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
                    So the evaluation of the information is provided expert assumptions made by CollegeNPV. 
                    Of course there is all sorts of factors that will vary based on many factors. Some that 
                    are listed include academic achievement and 
                    field of study. This information is suseptable to change over time.
                <li>
                    What form is the original source data?
                </li>
                <p> 
                    The source data comes from the 
                    <a href="https://www.ed.gov/" class="animated-link" target="_blank">U.S Department of Education </a> and the
                    <a href="https://www.bls.gov/emp/chart-unemployment-earnings-education.htm" class="animated-link" target="_blank"> Bureau of Labor Statistics </a>
                    .When looking up the two sites I see that the information is represented as either bar graphs or just text sheets. 
                </p>
                <li>
                    How does the presentation of the data impact your engagement?
                </li>
                <p>
                    The <a href="https://www.collegenpv.com/collegeroiheatmap" class="animated-link" target="_blank">College ROI Heatmap</a> is definietly a useful and engaging tool. 
                    Here is a picture of what that tool looks like: 
                </p>
                <div class="position-img"> 
                    <img src="img/collegenpv-diagram.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="college return on investment heatmap diagram">  
                </div>
                <p> 
                    Visually this already shows a person which majors pay out the most 
                    and which ones you might even try to avoid. It is very specific and 
                    using size,and color with the data helps convey the drastic differences 
                    in return on investments for the respective career fields
                </p>
                <li>
                    If you were to do the same thing, how would you do it?        
                </li>
                <p>
                    I understand that due to spacing restrictions they jumbled everything together so that you can see all of the options in one image
                    but what i would consider as another option is a using bar graphs on the site. But what is overall more important is for 
                    viewers to understand what this data means. I think having a better and more specific description on what ROI means 
                    and then the career field options are. More information is necessary on the interactive version, that way people understand what the data means for them.

                <p>
                    What you need to do:

                    Identify a number of Narratives that you are well 
                    familiar with
                    For each narrative engage with (a minimum of) the 
                    following questions: 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    
                    - Why is it interesting to you?
                </p>
                <h4>
                    look below, not a lot of writing, but way over the time limit
                </h4>

                    <p> 
                    - What is the 'data' in this narrative? - 
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                    The data I would say based off what i did below is the visuals. 
                    I was originally going to talk about music but I just spent so much time on what I did below that 
                    it makes sense to say that what you visually see on your screen is data
                    and that data creates an experience unlike the real world.     
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        
                    How does the form (i.e. the platform / media / interface)
                    impact your experience of the narrative? 
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                        the form impacts your experience alot because it is interactive.
                        It is alot more then just a movie because you can actually emerse yourself
                        in the experience.
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                    Would it be 
                    better/worse in a different form? - If the original 
                    creator were to re-tell the narrative today,
                    how would you want them to do it? What could they do 
                    to make it better for you?
                </p>
                <h4>
                    I think it would be worse in any form besides VR. Being able to 
                    explore new worlds by physically walking through them 
                    would be amazing. I really hope VR continues to grow into that space
                    where we can be fully invested into a digital atmosphere. However, 
                    if the someone was to retell the narrative today I think it would 
                    be super cool if they did a TV show. And you might say to me "Hey 
                    isn't there already a TV show" and my answer to that would be Yes, but
                    but it is the farthest thing from what the game actually is about.
                    I think one of the most interesting things about the game is it's storyline
                    so instead of just having cutscenes I think it could really benefit from 
                    a retelling of the story with most importantly, the same music. Music is 
                    so important in this series that it wouldn't be Halo if Marty wasn't 
                    bringing the heat on the piano.

                    Reflection 2:
                </h1>
                <p>
                My reflection is based of what Jessica Clemens spoke about friday
                </p>
                <p>
                        The discussion on technology in education reveals diverse perspectives 
                    on its impact and utility. Jessicia Clemens from the English department, focuses 
                    on rhetoric and composition.
                    She says that digital media studies are increasingly relevant. Historically, rhetoric 
                    dates back to around 600 BC, while composition as a formal discipline 
                    began to evolve in the 1960s. The field has grown to encompass multimodal 
                    approaches—incorporating not just traditional text but also 
                    visual, oral, and auditory elements. This shift highlights the benefits 
                    of combining various modes of expression beyond the conventional essay 
                    format, which is often mistakenly viewed as a single-mode medium. Additionally 
                    the concept of multimodal expression emphasizes the richness of combining 
                    different modes, which enhance communication and comprehension. 
                    She is also the writing center director, so
                    recognizing that expression is not limited to traditional models is crucial.
                    Her view challenges the standard norms of text, encouraging 
                    exploration beyond formats like Word documents.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                    Next she talks on digital humanities, which began with early in the 1960s. 
                    The focus now is on leveraging digital tools to address 
                    digital problems, acknowledging that technology has always been a part of 
                    writing and cultural expression. "Digital natives," those who have grown 
                    up surrounded by technology, are particularly more use to these tools. 
                    One thing Dr. Clemens like to think about in this space is "critical AI literacy," 
                    which is essential in an age where technology shapes communication and learning.

                    However, the debate over whether physical or digital writing is superior is not a good debate. 
                    In her eyes context plays a significant role. Each has their own advantages. I prefer digital writing 
                    for organization but some argue that physical writing 
                    offers a richer sensory experience. Although it is important to remember that assistive 
                    technologies also need to be part of this conversation to ensure equitable
                    access for all students.

                </p>
                <p>
                    One of I think the highlights of what Dr. Clemens talked about was that there 
                    should be no blanket 
                    bans on technology. This is so disadvantagous to learners who want to grow
                    in a space that we use every day. Dr. Clemens leas towards 
                    supporting technology use, especially when it addresses specific support needs.
                    This is why she stresses her digital literacy class and having discussions about 
                    technology's role in education.
                    We should help aim to equip students with critical skills and navigate digital spaces more
                    effectively.

                    Another important part she brought up was that when we think of technology 
                    we think of the newest thing. 
                    The impact of digital systems extends beyond the latest gadgets. Historical 
                    technologies, like typewriters, were once revolutionary, and writing itself 
                    has always been a form of technology. This perspective challenges how older
                    generations view this new digital space as something we should ignore. We 
                    should learn how to grow in this space in healthy practices rather then 
                    treat it as unecessary. 
                    </p>
                    <p>

                    Lastly, a question I asked her had to do with the 
                    value of video game communities. In the context of video games, 
                    understanding their importance involves 
                    recognizing them as part of discourse communities, similar to academia.
                    Video games foster unique communities and critical play, challenging 
                    the notion that writing and other intellectual activities must be
                    inherently difficult or exclusive. 
                    What I think is important to note is that the stigma surrounding digital 
                    writing and gaming is diminishing. What should happen is we should offer
                    a more participation in these fields. This overall I think is the point. 
                    Technology and digital media have transformed education and 
                    communication. We can use its tools to broaden access and enrich the ways 
                    we express and interact with content. And I think that is a beautiful thing.

                    Reflection 3
                </h1>
            <p>
                I was not able to be physically present for the presentations during class
                Which makes me want to talk about a specific point before
                i get into reflecting on these two presentations.
                </p>
                <p>
                I found out the other day that I have the Flu, I have never had the Flu
                before but I woke up one morning and I was so lathargic and exhausted
                that I could not will myself out of bed until the late afternoon. And it
                is funny when I did eventually went to the health center and the nurse told me
                that I shouldn't go to class and I said "well what if the mark me down points
                for not showing up?". And her response was "They should understand". But for
                one of my professors, when I emailed him that I was sick with the Flu
                He very quickly put in the gradebook that I had missed class. And so in his class I 
                have a B- because it is the only grade in the gradebook. And for me it's like
                "whats the alternative? I show up and get everybody sick?" In addition to this, I 
                have another professor with another policy that he has 4 random in class assignments 
                he makes his students do for attendance and I saw that it was possible I was missing the 
                one day I would need to be in class for participation because I had the Flu. So i 
                drove to his office hours and asked if I missed the assignment. And i told him i wasn't feeling 
                well and he seemed so shocked that I was there and kept his distance. And that just doesn't
                make any sense to me, why keep your distance if the only way I will get credit for class is showing up
                even if that means showing up sick and contagious.
                These policies make no sense to me. This doesn't happen in the workforce ever, why do we force students to 
                come to class when they are super sick or make them feel bad by taking points from them when they would
                rather respect the health of the students around them. It is such a loose loose situation and it makes 
                me not enjoy the classes that I am in because it makes me feel like I am not respected as an adult
                who is aware of how they feel and what is best for them
                </p> 
                <p>
                Back to the presentations, I found that both touched on how technology shapes 
                different aspects of our lives—whether it’s about 
                how we store our data or how we navigate choices 
                and behaviors influenced by free will and social media.
                <p>
                The first presentation focused on data storage, 
                something that we all need in our devices. 
                He highlighted the different ways we store our data, 
                from older forms like CDs and DVDs to more modern storage 
                solutions like SSDs and USB drives. SSDs, in particular, 
                stood out to me because of how they use flash memory to erase
                and rewrite data at the bit level which is hard to explain. 
                It is fascinating 
                how much faster and more reliable they are compared to 
                older technologies. Yet, despite all the advances, 
                it is true how fragile storage still is. 
                Phones can be dropped, and data can disappear in an instant which 
                was talked about in the presentation. 
                I realized that while it’s easy to take data storage for granted, 
                we really need to be proactive about backing up important information.
                I work on this personally with backing up important photos onto a hard drive
                that I can plug into my computer. I didnt know that there was 
                a profession of people called archivalists and there
                role is preserving data which is a wild thing to think about.
                Seeing how important it is to safeguard information should
                help people realize the importance of their own data and
                what they choose to do with it. 
                </p>
                <p>
                The second presentation was much more philosophical. It got into
                the concepts of free will, luck, and how technology, especially 
                social media, influences our daily decisions. I was interested in 
                the video shown that had a study that shows how the brain preps 
                us for actions
                before we’re even consciously aware of them. I think this is one 
                of those things that really 
                challenges the idea of free will. It makes me wonder how 
                much control I really have over my choices and maybe it means i have more
                control because my brain can stop my actions. I could hear in 
                the video that this point 
                sparked a larger conversation about religion, especially 
                the idea of free will in the story of Adam and Eve, and 
                whether our actions are truly our own if something or 
                someone (like God) already knows the outcome.
                </p>
                <p>
                The second part of his presentation was a discussion on social media 
                which I think is always important for our time.
                In general I noticed how personalized all of my
                friend groups social media feeds are and it is one of the reasons
                I got rid of mine. 
                And it’s eerie to think about how algorithms are constantly 
                adjusting what I see to keep me engaged when i do look at social media. 
                Hearing that some 
                people equate social media to dangerous tools, like an AR-15, 
                really emphasized how powerful and potentially harmful it can be. However 
                I think that analogy is a little extreme becaise AR-15 were built to kill
                I think social media was not made for the same purpose. But
                the idea that we’re spending hours a day scrolling without 
                realizing it does show how deeply social media is embedded in our 
                lives. It’s clear that we need to find a balance, especially 
                younger generations who are growing up fully immersed in these digital spaces.

                In reflecting on both presentations, I see a common theme of
                technology that has an immense influence on us, whether it’s in the 
                background silently storing our data or actively shaping our
                behaviors and decisions. Data storage feels like a technical 
                problem we all need to particpate in if we want to use technology long term, 
                but when it 
                comes to free will and social media, the lines between control 
                and influence become much more complicated. Both topics lead me to think on
                how much of my life is shaped by technology and sometimes 
                in ways I don’t even notice. It’s a reminder for me to be more mindful. It is
                also a reminder that I control what data I store and I should be
                aware of the tech that gets shoved in my face from the world.
