                Reflection: What are you excited about doing in this space?
            </h3>
            <p> I am excited in the freedom to create in the space I have been working 
                on all throughout college. I am very thrilled when I feel like what I am doing
                has a purpose and I can visually see the progress. I also like figuring out the connection
                people have with the digital space and understanding the importance of data from that connection. 
                I have been in this field for a while so I am already coming up with ideas
                on how I can make this class experience tailored to me.

                Why is it interesting to you?
            </li>
            <p>
                This topic interested me because it is relevant to what most of us care about. 
                We are told that we should go to college to get a degree so we can get a higher paying job. 
                But if you look at this chart it shows that some majors are not really worth it. 
            </p>
            <li>
                Where did the source data come from?
            </li>
            <p>
                <a href="https://www.collegenpv.com/" class="animated-link" target="_blank">CollegeNPV</a> 
                is a independent company that conductsanalysis of expected 
                financial outcomes of universities. 
                This information is useful for typical entering students interested in college.
                The calculations of the data are estimates based on
                publicly available data from the U.S. Department of Education and 
                Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
                So the evaluation of the information is provided expert assumptions made by CollegeNPV. 
                Of course there is all sorts of factors that will vary based on many factors. Some that 
                are listed include academic achievement and 
                field of study. This information is suseptable to change over time.
            <li>
                What form is the original source data?
            </li>
            <p> 
                The source data comes from the 
                <a href="https://www.ed.gov/" class="animated-link" target="_blank">U.S Department of Education </a> and the
                <a href="https://www.bls.gov/emp/chart-unemployment-earnings-education.htm" class="animated-link" target="_blank"> Bureau of Labor Statistics </a>
                .When looking up the two sites I see that the information is represented as either bar graphs or just text sheets. 
            </p>
            <li>
                How does the presentation of the data impact your engagement?
            </li>
            <p>
                The <a href="https://www.collegenpv.com/collegeroiheatmap" class="animated-link" target="_blank">College ROI Heatmap</a> is definietly a useful and engaging tool. 
                Here is a picture of what that tool looks like: 
            </p>

            </div>
            <p> 
                Visually this already shows a person which majors pay out the most 
                and which ones you might even try to avoid. It is very specific and 
                using size,and color with the data helps convey the drastic differences 
                in return on investments for the respective career fields
            </p>
            <li>
                If you were to do the same thing, how would you do it?        
            </li>
            <p>
                I understand that due to spacing restrictions they jumbled everything together so that you can see all of the options in one image
                but what i would consider as another option is a using bar graphs on the site. But what is overall more important is for 
                viewers to understand what this data means. I think having a better and more specific description on what ROI means 
                and then the career field options are. More information is necessary on the interactive version, that way people understand what the data means for them.

                What you need to do:

                Identify a number of Narratives that you are well 
                familiar with
                For each narrative engage with (a minimum of) the 
                following questions: 
                
                - Why is it interesting to you? 
                - What is the 'data' in this narrative? - 
                How does the form (i.e. the platform / media / interface)
                impact your experience of the narrative? Would it be 
                better/worse in a different form? - If the original 
                creator were to re-tell the narrative today,
                how would you want them to do it? What could they do 
                to make it better for you?

                Reflection: DRAFT
            </h1>
            <p>
            My reflection is based of what Jessica Clemens spoke about friday
            </p>
            <p>
                    The discussion on technology in education reveals diverse perspectives 
                on its impact and utility. In the English department, where the focus 
                includes rhetoric and composition, 
                digital media studies are increasingly relevant. Historically, rhetoric 
                dates back to around 600 BC, while composition as a formal discipline 
                began to evolve in the 1960s. The field has grown to encompass multimodal 
                approaches—incorporating not just traditional alphanumeric text but also 
                visual, oral, and auditory elements. This shift highlights the benefits 
                of combining various modes of expression beyond the conventional essay 
                format, which is often mistakenly viewed as a single-mode medium.

                The concept of multimodal expression emphasizes the richness of combining 
                different modes, such as color-coded text or multimedia elements, which 
                enhance communication and comprehension. As a writing center director, 
                recognizing that expression is not limited to traditional models is crucial.
                It challenges the standard norms of textual presentation, encouraging 
                exploration beyond conventional formats like Word documents.

                The advent of digital humanities, which began with early conversations 
                about integrating computers into the humanities around 1966, reflects an 
                ongoing evolution. The focus now is on leveraging digital tools to address 
                digital problems, acknowledging that technology has always been a part of 
                writing and cultural expression. "Digital natives," those who have grown 
                up surrounded by technology, are particularly adept at navigating and 
                critiquing these tools. This includes understanding "critical AI literacy," 
                which is essential in an age where technology shapes communication and learning.

                The debate over whether physical or digital writing is superior is nuanced. 
                Context plays a significant role, and while some argue that physical writing 
                offers a richer sensory experience, digital writing provides advantages such
                as accessibility and integration with other digital tools. Assistive 
                technologies also need to be part of this conversation to ensure equitable
                access for all students.

                Concerns about equity and access are paramount. There should be no blanket 
                bans on technology that disadvantage learners. Personal opinions lean towards 
                supporting technology use, especially when it addresses specific support needs.
                Digital literacy classes and discussions about technology's role in education
                aim to equip students with critical skills and navigate digital spaces more
                effectively.

                The impact of digital systems extends beyond the latest gadgets. Historical 
                technologies, like typewriters, were once revolutionary, and writing itself 
                has always been a form of technology. This perspective challenges the notion
                that newer technologies are inherently superior or that older methods are 
                obsolete.

                Social media dynamics, such as those in parenting groups, illustrate the 
                complexities of digital communication. Analyzing discourse in these spaces 
                reveals how advertisements and rhetoric influence discussions on topics like 
                breastfeeding versus bottle-feeding. This highlights the need for critical 
                engagement with digital content.

                As a manager of an open-access journal, it's clear that digital platforms 
                have democratized access to academic knowledge, reducing barriers imposed 
                by traditional print journals. This shift allows more scholars to contribute
                and access information without navigating restrictive gatekeeping practices.

                In the context of video games, understanding their importance involves 
                recognizing them as part of discourse communities, similar to academia.
                Video games foster unique communities and critical play, challenging 
                the notion that writing and other intellectual activities must be
                inherently difficult or exclusive. The stigma surrounding digital 
                writing and gaming is diminishing, offering a more inclusive
                perspective on participation in these fields.

                Overall, technology and digital media have transformed education and 
                communication, broadening access and enriching the ways we express and 
                interact with content.
