        Why is it interesting to you?

    <p>
        This topic interested me because it is relevant to what most of us care about. 
        We are told that we should go to college to get a degree so we can get a higher paying job. 
        But if you look at this chart it shows that some majors are not really worth it.

        Where did the source data come from?

    <p>
        <a href="https://www.collegenpv.com/" class="college-roi-link">CollegeNPV</a> conducts independent analysis of expected 
        financial outcomes of universities for typical entering students for 
        informational purposes.
         Outcome valuation calculations are estimates based on
          publicly available data from the U.S. Department of Education and 
          Bureau of Labor Statistics, information provided by the user and 
          other expert assumptions made by CollegeNPV. 
          Real outcomes will vary based on many factors, 
          including but not limited to, academic achievement and 
          field of study. This information can change over time and might not 
          apply to you. Images of universities are artistic representations 
          and may not be accurate depictions.
