            Reflection: What are you excited about doing in this space?
        </h3>
        <p> I am excited in the freedom to create in the space I have been working 
            on all throughout college. I am very thrilled when I feel like what I am doing
            has a purpose and I can visually see the progress. I also like figuring out the connection
            people have with the digital space and understanding the importance of data from that connection. 
            I have been in this field for a while so I am already coming up with ideas
            on how I can make this class experience tailored to me.

            Why is it interesting to you?
        </li>
        <p>
            This topic interested me because it is relevant to what most of us care about. 
            We are told that we should go to college to get a degree so we can get a higher paying job. 
            But if you look at this chart it shows that some majors are not really worth it. 
        </p>
        <li>
            Where did the source data come from?
        </li>
        <p>
            <a href="https://www.collegenpv.com/" class="animated-link" target="_blank">CollegeNPV</a> 
            is a independent company that conductsanalysis of expected 
            financial outcomes of universities. 
            This information is useful for typical entering students interested in college.
            The calculations of the data are estimates based on
            publicly available data from the U.S. Department of Education and 
            Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
            So the evaluation of the information is provided expert assumptions made by CollegeNPV. 
            Of course there is all sorts of factors that will vary based on many factors. Some that 
            are listed include academic achievement and 
            field of study. This information is suseptable to change over time.
        <li>
            What form is the original source data?
        </li>
        <p> 
            The source data comes from the 
            <a href="https://www.ed.gov/" class="animated-link" target="_blank">U.S Department of Education </a> and the
            <a href="https://www.bls.gov/emp/chart-unemployment-earnings-education.htm" class="animated-link" target="_blank"> Bureau of Labor Statistics </a>
            .When looking up the two sites I see that the information is represented as either bar graphs or just text sheets. 
        </p>
        <li>
            How does the presentation of the data impact your engagement?
        </li>
        <p>
            The <a href="https://www.collegenpv.com/collegeroiheatmap" class="animated-link" target="_blank">College ROI Heatmap</a> is definietly a useful and engaging tool. 
            Here is a picture of what that tool looks like: 
        </p>

        </div>
        <p> 
            Visually this already shows a person which majors pay out the most 
            and which ones you might even try to avoid. It is very specific and 
            using size,and color with the data helps convey the drastic differences 
            in return on investments for the respective career fields
        </p>
        <li>
            If you were to do the same thing, how would you do it?        
        </li>
        <p>
            I understand that due to spacing restrictions they jumbled everything together so that you can see all of the options in one image
            but what i would consider as another option is a using bar graphs on the site. But what is overall more important is for 
            viewers to understand what this data means. I think having a better and more specific description on what ROI means 
            and then the career field options are. More information is necessary on the interactive version, that way people understand what the data means for them.
