                Reflection: What are you excited about doing in this space?
            </h3>
            <p> I am excited in the freedom to create in the space I have been working 
                on all throughout college. I am very thrilled when I feel like what I am doing
                has a purpose and I can visually see the progress. I also like figuring out the connection
                people have with the digital space and understanding the importance of data from that connection. 
                I have been in this field for a while so I am already coming up with ideas
                on how I can make this class experience tailored to me.  
            </p>

                Why is it interesting to you?
            </li>
            <p>
                This topic interested me because it is relevant to what most of us care about. 
                We are told that we should go to college to get a degree so we can get a higher paying job. 
                But if you look at this chart it shows that some majors are not really worth it. 
            </p>
            <li>
                Where did the source data come from?
            </li>
            <p>
                <a href="https://www.collegenpv.com/" class="animated-link" target="_blank">CollegeNPV</a> 
                is a independent company that conductsanalysis of expected 
                financial outcomes of universities. 
                This information is useful for typical entering students interested in college.
                The calculations of the data are estimates based on
                publicly available data from the U.S. Department of Education and 
                Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
                So the evaluation of the information is provided expert assumptions made by CollegeNPV. 
                Of course there is all sorts of factors that will vary based on many factors. Some that 
                are listed include academic achievement and 
                field of study. This information is suseptable to change over time.
            <li>
                What form is the original source data?
            </li>
            <p> 
                The source data comes from the 
                <a href="https://www.ed.gov/" class="animated-link" target="_blank">U.S Department of Education </a> and the
                <a href="https://www.bls.gov/emp/chart-unemployment-earnings-education.htm" class="animated-link" target="_blank"> Bureau of Labor Statistics </a>
                .When looking up the two sites I see that the information is represented as either bar graphs or just text sheets. 
            </p>
            <li>
                How does the presentation of the data impact your engagement?
            </li>
            <p>
                The <a href="https://www.collegenpv.com/collegeroiheatmap" class="animated-link" target="_blank">College ROI Heatmap</a> is definietly a useful and engaging tool. 
                Here is a picture of what that tool looks like:

            <p> 
                Visually this already shows a person which majors pay out the most 
                and which ones you might even try to avoid. It is very specific and 
                using size,and color with the data helps convey the drastic differences 
                in return on investments for the respective career fields
            </p>
            <li>
                If you were to do the same thing, how would you do it?        
            </li>
            <p>
                I understand that due to spacing restrictions they jumbled everything together so that you can see all of the options in one image
                but what i would consider as another option is a using bar graphs on the site. But what is overall more important is for 
                viewers to understand what this data means. I think having a better and more specific description on what ROI means 
                and then the career field options are. More information is necessary on the interactive version, that way people understand what the data means for them.

                What you need to do:

                Identify a number of Narratives that you are well 
                familiar with
                For each narrative engage with (a minimum of) the 
                following questions: 
                </p>
                <p>
                
                - Why is it interesting to you?
            </p>
            <h4>
                look below, not a lot of writing, but way over the time limit
            </h4>

                <p> 
                - What is the 'data' in this narrative? - 
                </p>
                <h4>
                   The data I would say based off what i did below is the visuals. 
                   I was originally going to talk about music but I just spent so much time on what I did below that 
                   it makes sense to say that what you visually see on your screen is data
                   and that data creates an experience unlike the real world.     
                </h4>
                <p>
                    
                How does the form (i.e. the platform / media / interface)
                impact your experience of the narrative? 
                </p>
                <h4>
                    the form impacts your experience alot because it is interactive.
                    It is alot more then just a movie because you can actually emerse yourself
                    in the experience.
                </h4>
                <p>
                Would it be 
                better/worse in a different form? - If the original 
                creator were to re-tell the narrative today,
                how would you want them to do it? What could they do 
                to make it better for you?
            </p>
            <h4>
                I think it would be worse in any form besides VR. Being able to 
                explore new worlds by physically walking through them 
                would be amazing. I really hope VR continues to grow into that space
                where we can be fully invested into a digital atmosphere. However, 
                if the someone was to retell the narrative today I think it would 
                be super cool if they did a TV show. And you might say to me "Hey 
                isn't there already a TV show" and my answer to that would be Yes, but
                but it is the farthest thing from what the game actually is about.
                I think one of the most interesting things about the game is it's storyline
                so instead of just having cutscenes I think it could really benefit from 
                a retelling of the story with most importantly, the same music. Music is 
                so important in this series that it wouldn't be Halo if Marty wasn't 
                bringing the heat on the piano.

            <h1>
                Reflection:
            </h1>
            <p>
            My reflection is based of what Jessica Clemens spoke about friday
            </p>
            <p>
                    The discussion on technology in education reveals diverse perspectives 
                on its impact and utility. Jessicia Clemens from the English department, focuses 
                on rhetoric and composition.
                She says that digital media studies are increasingly relevant. Historically, rhetoric 
                dates back to around 600 BC, while composition as a formal discipline 
                began to evolve in the 1960s. The field has grown to encompass multimodal 
                approaches—incorporating not just traditional text but also 
                visual, oral, and auditory elements. This shift highlights the benefits 
                of combining various modes of expression beyond the conventional essay 
                format, which is often mistakenly viewed as a single-mode medium. Additionally 
                the concept of multimodal expression emphasizes the richness of combining 
                different modes, which enhance communication and comprehension. 
                She is also the writing center director, so
                recognizing that expression is not limited to traditional models is crucial.
                Her view challenges the standard norms of text, encouraging 
                exploration beyond formats like Word documents.

                Next she talks on digital humanities, which began with early in the 1960s. 
                The focus now is on leveraging digital tools to address 
                digital problems, acknowledging that technology has always been a part of 
                writing and cultural expression. "Digital natives," those who have grown 
                up surrounded by technology, are particularly more use to these tools. 
                One thing Dr. Clemens like to think about in this space is "critical AI literacy," 
                which is essential in an age where technology shapes communication and learning.

                However, the debate over whether physical or digital writing is superior is not a good debate. 
                In her eyes context plays a significant role. Each has their own advantages. I prefer digital writing 
                for organization but some argue that physical writing 
                offers a richer sensory experience. Although it is important to remember that assistive 
                technologies also need to be part of this conversation to ensure equitable
                access for all students.

            </p>
            <p>
                One of I think the highlights of what Dr. Clemens talked about was that there 
                should be no blanket 
                bans on technology. This is so disadvantagous to learners who want to grow
                in a space that we use every day. Dr. Clemens leas towards 
                supporting technology use, especially when it addresses specific support needs.
                This is why she stresses her digital literacy class and having discussions about 
                technology's role in education.
                We should help aim to equip students with critical skills and navigate digital spaces more
                effectively.

                Another important part she brought up was that when we think of technology 
                we think of the newest thing. 
                The impact of digital systems extends beyond the latest gadgets. Historical 
                technologies, like typewriters, were once revolutionary, and writing itself 
                has always been a form of technology. This perspective challenges how older
                generations view this new digital space as something we should ignore. We 
                should learn how to grow in this space in healthy practices rather then 
                treat it as unecessary. 
                </p>
                <p>

                Lastly, a question I asked her had to do with the 
                value of video game communities. In the context of video games, 
                understanding their importance involves 
                recognizing them as part of discourse communities, similar to academia.
                Video games foster unique communities and critical play, challenging 
                the notion that writing and other intellectual activities must be
                inherently difficult or exclusive. 
                What I think is important to note is that the stigma surrounding digital 
                writing and gaming is diminishing. What should happen is we should offer
                a more participation in these fields. This overall I think is the point. 
                Technology and digital media have transformed education and 
                communication. We can use its tools to broaden access and enrich the ways 
                we express and interact with content. And I think that is a beautiful thing.
