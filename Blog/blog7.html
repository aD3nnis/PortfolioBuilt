    <h1>
        Bad Data Exploration
    </h1>
    <h2>
        Data whose originator had good intentions
    </h2>
    <h4>
        Milgram Study
    </h4>
    <p>
        I learned about this in my psychology class. It was also known as the shock study but the intention was to find out how people responded to authority. However it was mentally not good for the poeple who were being experiemented on. Why it was not good for them was because they were made to believe that they were harming someone.

    </h2>
    <h3>
        Misleading political polls
    </h3>
    <p>
        So when data is shared can have an effect on election polls. 
        In October 2016, just 11 days before the U.S. presidential election, 
        then-FBI Director James Comey announced the reopening of the investigation 
        into Hillary Clinton's private email server. This announcement dominated news cycles, 
        and polls conducted in the immediate aftermath showed a sudden dip in Clinton's support.
    </p>
    <p>
        Polls conducted in the days immediately following the announcement 
        capitalized on the temporary shock and outrage among voters. 
        So what was seen is there was a sharp decline in support for Clinton.

    <h2>
        Data which is bad for being misleading
    </h2>
    <h3>
        Paid fake reviews on platforms like Amazon.
    </h3>
    <p>
        First of all, its funny how easily you can get political with this stuff which is sad. 
        Like shouldn't people in government be the most honest with their civilians? 
        So what i went with instead is Companies or individuals write fake positive reviews for their products or negative ones for competitors.
         This misleads consumers into making poor purchasing decisions.

    <h2>
        Data which is bad for being misleading
    </h2>
    <h3>
        Temu manipulating viewers with false images of product
    </h3>
    <p>
        This was from personal experience but I was looking at some containers on temu that I wanted to put clothes in. 
        So I found two pictures that demonstrate this and its of this girl stacking boxes
        In the first photo it looks like 2 boxes are about her height. when in the other picture two boxes are about her height when 
        she is sitting down. The first picture is the clickbait picture shown first with the item and it is a cheep way of decieving people
        into thinking they are getting a good deal with huge boxes when they ae actually smaller in reality.

        Technology/AI Ethics
    </h3>
    <p>
        AI systems trained on biased data sets lead to facial recognition software that misidentifies people of certain racial groups.
        I remeber reading about how google photos 
  
    <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/07/01/google-photos-mistakenly-labels-black-people-gorillas/">
        mislabeled black people as gorillas

  <h3>
    Questions:
  </h3>
  <p>
    <b>
        What is the context of this data? Does the context matter for your classification? 
    </b>
    The context does matter because some of these examples could be for every one of these catagories. So even me catagorizing them shows how I feel about the data. This is because I catagorized based off what I felt best described the prompt and that might be different for someone else. 
    For example, I picked Temu manipulating images as misleading but someone might find a stronger argument is that temu had bad intentions because they want people to make mistakes. In this case we put emphasis on different parts of the problem which shows how we view the data individually. 
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>
        What is your connection to this data and the 'bad' classification you are giving it?
    </b>
    My connection to the data is that I have heard about these things happening. Everything I picked comes from my own knowledge bank and how I got the data was doing a google search to see what I thought was remembered correctly. 
    So I have a somewhat personal connection with them which is why I thought they were worth sharing. The emotions I had when remebering the data reminded me of a bad experience and the use of the data confirmed my emotions and thoughts.
    This is how I would classify it as bad, at first and emotion feeling that something is wrong and then checking the facts and seeing if a statistical, visual, or tangiable bad outcome came out of that experience.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>
        What is your response? i.e. do you want to correct it? do you want to push back? do you want to hide it? do you want to re-contextualize?
    </b>
    I definitley don't want to hide the bad data, I think thats a huge reason for what makes it bad. We can so easliy show just what we want people to see so encouraging that by hiding what we know to be true is adding to the problem.
    Of course I would want to correct it but thats like asking do you want to correct poverty. Of course I don't want people to be in poverty but that is such a complicated solution. I don't think I really understand the question
    do you want to re-contextualize because the these are bad forms of data and I dont want to make it seem like its good data because thats misleading. Maybe its good data in the fact we can show people what not to do.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>
        Attempting to empathize with the creator / render-er / owner of the data: how do you think they would respond to your classification of their data as 'bad?'
    </b>
    I think some would really care and others would not. I think google photos would 100% agree with me that they messed up and that is a bad form of data so being able to push back and let them know its bad data helps prevent it from happening in the future.
    Do I think a company like temu cares they are manipulating people into buying their product? No, I think they would appreciate that I am letting them know their scammy tactics are working and they would increase that form of manipulation. So it depends and in this case context depends and company values matter.
    I think this is a great thing to think about when buying from a company or trying to work for one. The way these companies approach bad data will tell you 
    alot about what they value.
