        Reflection 5
    </h1>
    <p>
        In a recent guest lecture, Dr. Emerson, a cultural historian who has been teaching at Whitworth University for eight years as part of the honors program, shared his insights on the intersection of history and data. Dr. Emerson emphasized that, in history, data often manifests as words, yet words can operate in a variety of ways, shaping how we understand the past. He is particularly invested in understanding the lived experiences of those whose voices are absent from traditional historical records. People he mentioned are enslaved individuals who were unable to write about their lives. This raises the critical question of how historians can construct a complete picture of their history without having access to the primary data that writing typically provides. Dr. Emerson also discussed the concept of presentism, a term used to describe the tendency to judge the past through the lens of contemporary values and questions. He warned of the danger in assuming that people in the past were not asking the "right" questions, as what we consider important today may not have been relevant in their time. This caution extends to how we consume and interpret data through various media. One thing that comes to mind that he discussed is the idea that “the medium is the message.” Dr. Emerson also pointed out that we often focus on the content of historical data but overlook the form in which that content is delivered. Ignoring the medium can lead to misunderstandings. He highlighted the risks involved in transferring data from hard copies to digital formats, noting that human error can alter the content during this process.

    The transition from oral to written communication has already shifted how we think and learn, and now the digital age is adding another layer to this evolution. Dr. Emerson talked about the ongoing debate about whether ebooks are inferior to traditional hard-copy textbooks for learning retention. He suggested that while written texts may currently benefit retention more than digital texts, we may be witnessing the beginning of a new phase in human development, one that could eventually favor digital formats. This idea aligns with the work of Ted Chiang, a short story writer whom Dr. Emerson referenced. Chiang explores the concept of perfect memory, where technology could record everything we see and hear, allowing us to search for and retrieve precise moments from the past. But Dr. Emerson questioned whether this would reveal the "truth of fact" or the "truth of feeling," and he noted that the pursuit of an objective truth is always influenced by subjective interpretation.

    Another question that was asked for Dr. Emerson was the limitations of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) in historical research. AI, while powerful in processing written text, struggles with the "silences" in history meaning the unspoken. Undocumented aspects of human experience that are crucial to understanding the full context of events are not covered in the AI databases. He described historical work as involving fact creation, fact assembly, and fact retrieval which are important steps AI would have to replicate. The challenge, he suggested, is that AI relies on language models built from pre-existing written text, which means it can predict trends but cannot capture the nuances of human experience in the same way a historian might. Dr. Emerson acknowledged that new technologies like AI can feel intimidating, much like past innovations that forced changes in how we process and store knowledge. Historically, humans have adapted by using tools to extend our capabilities, and he urged students to see AI not as a threat but as a tool that can enhance their research if used effectively. This perspective is especially relevant in today's interdisciplinary academic environment, where the boundaries between technology and the humanities are increasingly blurred.

    Dr. Emerson’s lecture highlighted the evolving relationship between data, history, and technology. While there will always be blind spots in our understanding of the past, historians must continue to investigate language, context, and medium to piece together the most accurate picture possible. As history intersects with AI and machine learning, the role of the historian may evolve, but the fundamental work of interpreting the past through a critical lens remains unchanged.
