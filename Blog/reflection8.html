<h1>
    My survey
</h1>
<p> 
    for my reflection this time I am going to look at my survey data for digital humanities. 
</p>
<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19y0xxj8MFuEFBbLZz9DaM5wg5jdhK9pK67lcQLjJtvg/edit?usp=sharing">Link to Survey Data</a>
<p>
    It was mostly freshman and sophmores that took my survey
    a total of 18 people took the survey. About 75% of those people who took the survey were male
</p>
<p>
    8/18 were computer science majors which is about 44% of people.

</p>
<p>
    They way that i determined how tech positive this class was by asking a set of 9 questions that ask about tech being used in the classroom. I would rate their answers as either negative positive or nuetral. Then i would take the some of those and see what the overall classes score was. I can see that this class leans positive with how they feel about technology
    The classes score is a 4
</p>
<p>
    what is interesting but probably not suprising is that if I solo out computer science majors the score increase to 4.7 and the rest of the class is 3.2. What is interesting is that handwriting liking is pretty similar with both groups. What is also interesting is that handwritting liking also stays similar across males and females. In general however, the handwriting likeness does lean negative being 2.6/5 with 3 being nuetral. 
</p>
<p>
    so what is important to note with this class is that handwriting liking does not change with gender or CS majors 
</p>
<p>
    what I think is interesting is that 85% of people dont own an Ipad
</p>
<p>
    also 70% said that getting good grades are important for college and 90% saying manageable workload being the top answer. 
</p>
<p>
    what was also interesting was that besides me, there were no CS majors that were females
