        Good Data Exploration
    </h1>
    <p>
        Data was taken from presentations given in class, all the way down are my noted, and the data I used.
    </p>
   
   
    <h2>
        Data whose originator had good intentions
    </h2>
    <h4>
        Data from the Pro Football Focus (PFF) platform.
    </h4>
    <p>
        PFF collects and analyzes performance data on football players, teams, and games to provide detailed insights for fans, teams, and analysts.  
        The data serves to deepen understanding of the game, making it accessible to both casual fans and professionals.

        <h2>
        Data whose originator had bad intentions
    </h2>
    <h3>
        Scams targeting elders or crypto fraud
    </h3>
    <p>
        Scammers will target individuals of vunerabile populations like the people who do not understand technology as well as others.
        This is why the elderly are an easy target and why they need to be informed and protected.
        Scammers have the intention of sending out data for bad because they want people in return to give them data that they will use to commit fraud.
        Although originating from malicious activities, tracking this data highlights vulnerabilities and raises awareness to prevent future crimes.

     </p>
    <p>
        The nutritional data for SIGGI'S yogurt from your notes provides detailed information about its energy content, macronutrients, micronutrients, and ingredients. The data includes values per 100g and per 150g serving size, making it informative for anyone comparing this yogurt to others or trying to monitor their intake of specific nutrients.
        This data is useful for anyone interested in the nutritional value of specific food products. For example, it could be valuable for those tracking their protein intake, managing their sugar consumption, or looking for low-fat options.

    Questions
    <h3>
        <b>What is the context of this data? Does the context matter for your classification?</b>
      </h3>
      <p>
        The context does matter because the classification of data can vary depending on how we perceive its origin and use. For example, PFF's data, originating from a platform that provides insights for fans and analysts, is clearly intended for positive engagement, which leads me to classify it as good data. On the other hand, scams targeting the elderly, such as crypto fraud, have a malicious intent, making it clear why it falls under the category of "bad" data. The classification may differ based on personal perspectives and how individuals view the data, whether it's used for good or bad purposes.
      </p>
      
      <h3>
        <b>What is your connection to this data and the 'bad' classification you are giving it?</b>
      </h3>
      <p>
        My connection to the "bad" data, such as scams targeting vulnerable populations, comes from my awareness of these issues through media and personal experience. For example, knowing how crypto scams exploit individuals who may not fully understand technology made me classify it as bad data. This classification is also influenced by how I feel about the ethical implications of such practices. When I researched these topics, it confirmed my emotions that this kind of data usage leads to harmful outcomes, like financial loss and exploitation.
      </p>
      
      <h3>
        <b>What is your response? i.e. do you want to correct it? do you want to push back? do you want to hide it? do you want to re-contextualize?</b>
      </h3>
      <p>
        I do not want to hide the "bad" data; in fact, exposing and discussing it is crucial for raising awareness and preventing further harm. While I would want to correct the malicious data, like fraud schemes, the solution is not simple. It’s a broader issue of protecting vulnerable populations, and the data highlights the need for systemic changes. I wouldn't re-contextualize bad data to make it seem good, but rather, I see it as an opportunity to inform and help people understand how to avoid falling victim to such practices.
      </p>
      
      <h3>
        <b>Attempting to empathize with the creator/owner of the data: how do you think they would respond to your classification of their data as 'bad'?</b>
      </h3>
      <p>
        The creators of data like PFF, which is intended for good, would likely agree with my classification of their data as informative and helpful. However, in the case of scams or fraud, such as crypto fraud targeting elders, the creators would likely dismiss or ignore the "bad" classification, as their goal is to manipulate for profit. In such cases, these companies likely value profits over ethical concerns, which is why they might not care about being classified as using "bad" data. Understanding how companies respond to the classification of their data gives valuable insight into their values and ethics.

        there is a spectrum that can be divided into 4 quadrants in how they interact with the video game
        either you are reacting or interacting to a video game
        so either you are leading the action or taking in the action
        the categories are:
        done in 1996
        achievers: are ones who want to show their progress
        explorers: the ones who like looking at the world
        social: most common one, want to enjoy time with friends
        competitors: competing with others 
        what games are people drawn to in these fields

        american football
        analytics track football stats
        how can fans get more involved
        pro football focus provides data for teams and used to give performance grades
        he watched on youtube a channel that talks about football that talks about pff and it talks about data and stats and the stats show how well they do
        there is data for receiver tide ends and quarter backs
        stats are also collected by espn and nfl and people will comment on it on x
        graphics for the different nfl
        teams are used to show the stats of different teams
        its funny how he says I don't know why they dress up and do all this stuff to show the stats but that is really what ux/ui is all about. It’s entertaining it is different it is fun.

            hacking
            hacking is about finding vunerabilities
            but more importantly it is about problem solving
            it ties into digital humanities
            if data is stolen it can harm people
            ILOVEYOU: was a virus that was disguised as a virus
            target was breached and got millions of credit cards within the system in 2013
            560,000 ne malware pieces detected daily
            81% of organizations faced malware threats, phishing attacks and password attacks
            personal collection of data for this was nmap, metasploit, burp suite, social engineering
            it’s not just about tech its about asking what is the impact of this and that is how it ties into digital humanities

         block chain - a digital ledger of transactions where each linked block is a list of transactions
        chain of blocks - linked list of transactions
        decentralized - network of nodes
        transparency - public transactions
        security - hashing
        consensus mechanism - proof of work or proof of stake
        transaction creation, verification, block formation, validation, addition, and distribution is how the blockchain works
              security and transparency as well as reaching decentralization immutability and reduced costs.
        is reasons for the blockchain
        
        definition of digital humanities is be curious about human concerns and looking at the blockchain we should be accountable and be innovative.
        currently their is tech limits

        FL studio
        Core data types in FL studio: 
        MIDI data: notes
        you can place notes
        and you can set key and scale that you want to be in 
        you really don't have to know music theory in order to use it effectively 
        AI music tools : 
        landr, remastered are both tools that he used
        he also used a sampling library called splice,
        you can get vocals and instrumentals with splice
        He showed a graph of automation and how volume is represented in the graph
        This all matters to him because he is passionate about it
        and it is important for digital humanities because it lessens the barriers for people who do not know music as well as those who study it

          Personal data
        digital refers to digits
        and digital technology refers to a computer made by Alan turning
        it is something that holds memory that effects other memory 
        for example binary data can hold many different values based off how we present it
        data to the presenter is anything that can be formated
        information is everywhere and anything that can be meaningfully talked about then that is information that can be extrapolated into a format which he calls data
        formatting is essentially implicitly asking a question
        data is either collected or produced by a person
        who should be able to manage the data is not what he is focusing on
        how different people think about personal data and how they take action with that thought process
        they want to look at the motivations for people who post, or just comment, or people who don’t post at all.
        privacy is being violated but people are okay with it because they do not directly see it effecting them which is something to explore and collect data on.
        what do you think makes people not care about their privacy being
