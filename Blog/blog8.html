        PFF collects and analyzes performance data on football players, teams, and games to provide detailed insights for fans, teams, and analysts.

        Scams targeting elders or crypto fraud
    </h3>
    <p>
        Scammers will target individuals of vunerabile populations like the people who do not understand technology as well as others.
        This is why the elderly are an easy target and why they need to be informed and protected.
        Scammers have the intention of sending out data for bad because they want people in return to give them data that they will use to commit fraud.
        Although originating from malicious activities, tracking this data highlights vulnerabilities and raises awareness to prevent future crimes.

    Questions
    <h3>
        <b>What is the context of this data? Does the context matter for your classification?</b>
      </h3>
      <p>
        The context does matter because the classification of data can vary depending on how we perceive its origin and use. For example, PFF's data, originating from a platform that provides insights for fans and analysts, is clearly intended for positive engagement, which leads me to classify it as good data. On the other hand, scams targeting the elderly, such as crypto fraud, have a malicious intent, making it clear why it falls under the category of "bad" data. The classification may differ based on personal perspectives and how individuals view the data, whether it's used for good or bad purposes.
      </p>
      
      <h3>
        <b>What is your connection to this data and the 'bad' classification you are giving it?</b>
      </h3>
      <p>
        My connection to the "bad" data, such as scams targeting vulnerable populations, comes from my awareness of these issues through media and personal experience. For example, knowing how crypto scams exploit individuals who may not fully understand technology made me classify it as bad data. This classification is also influenced by how I feel about the ethical implications of such practices. When I researched these topics, it confirmed my emotions that this kind of data usage leads to harmful outcomes, like financial loss and exploitation.
      </p>
      
      <h3>
        <b>What is your response? i.e. do you want to correct it? do you want to push back? do you want to hide it? do you want to re-contextualize?</b>
      </h3>
      <p>
        I do not want to hide the "bad" data; in fact, exposing and discussing it is crucial for raising awareness and preventing further harm. While I would want to correct the malicious data, like fraud schemes, the solution is not simple. It’s a broader issue of protecting vulnerable populations, and the data highlights the need for systemic changes. I wouldn't re-contextualize bad data to make it seem good, but rather, I see it as an opportunity to inform and help people understand how to avoid falling victim to such practices.
      </p>
      
      <h3>
        <b>Attempting to empathize with the creator/owner of the data: how do you think they would respond to your classification of their data as 'bad'?</b>
      </h3>
      <p>
        The creators of data like PFF, which is intended for good, would likely agree with my classification of their data as informative and helpful. However, in the case of scams or fraud, such as crypto fraud targeting elders, the creators would likely dismiss or ignore the "bad" classification, as their goal is to manipulate for profit. In such cases, these companies likely value profits over ethical concerns, which is why they might not care about being classified as using "bad" data. Understanding how companies respond to the classification of their data gives valuable insight into their values and ethics.
