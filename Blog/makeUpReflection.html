        Make up reflection
    </h3>

During a recent discussion with political scientist, Dr. Hitefiledt, I gained valuable insights into the world of elections, voting patterns, and political behavior, particularly in the U.S. Understanding these aspects is what he focuses on and it is crucial for grasping why election outcomes unfold the way they do, like why some candidates win while others lose. The political scientist I observed dedicated his daily work to analyzing these dynamics, focusing on both general and primary elections, mainly congressional ones. His expertise lies not in qualitative analysis but in data-driven political science. He emphasized that the modern study of politics is centered on understanding human behavior through the lens of data.

    One of the striking points he made was about the role of campaign funding. He noted that about 90% of the time, the candidate who raises the most money ends up winning the election. This statistic emphasizes the strong connection between financial resources and electoral success. It also highlights an intriguing dynamic: candidates who are not actively asking for donations are essentially not asking for votes. This viewpoint reshaped my understanding of self-funding campaigns. While it might seem advantageous for wealthy candidates to fund their own campaigns, he pointed out that this actually makes it more difficult for them to win. This was a perspective I hadn’t considered before and gave me a new lens through which to view election strategies.

    Additionally, he talked about his passion for working with survey data and conducting experiments. His love for this type of work aligns with the current trend in political science to rely on empirical evidence. Good science, as he put it, is communal—it thrives on collaboration and contributions from different disciplines. For example, historians offer crucial insights into past events, helping political scientists piece together a fuller picture of voting patterns and political shifts. One such historical anecdote he shared involved how, in earlier times, political parties in control would manipulate voting results by using wax to cover ballots and later change votes to their desired outcome. This piece of history was both fascinating and chilling, as it showed the lengths to which some parties would go to control elections.

    A question raised by another person touched on how we know these manipulations happened if data is often obscured or unavailable. The political scientist responded by stressing the importance of historical context and interdisciplinary work, where departments like history offer evidence that political scientists can use to draw conclusions about past behaviors.

    I also appreciated his analogy comparing politics to the field of health and nutrition. In today’s world, many people feel like they “know everything” about certain topics due to the vast availability of information online. He used the example of people believing they know all about exercise or diet because of what they consume through media, and the same phenomenon applies to politics. His example of an uncle who thinks he knows everything about politics resonated with me. It’s a reflection of how media consumption creates the illusion of expertise in fields that people spend years studying.

Another point that I found interesting was his discussion of the mathematical side of political science. For instance, the decision to place state capitals is not random but based on statistical analysis, particularly population density within states. I hadn’t previously thought about how these seemingly political decisions could be rooted in data and statistics, and this revelation made me realize how much more mathematical and analytical political science can be than it initially appears.

I don't think I have ever had the opportunity to listen to a political scientist and so his perspective deepened my understanding of elections and political behavior in ways I hadn’t anticipated. The reliance on data, the critical role of campaign financing, and the interdisciplinary nature of political science all contribute to a nuanced picture of how elections operate. The insights I gained from this will definitely help shape the way I think about politics and elections moving forward.
