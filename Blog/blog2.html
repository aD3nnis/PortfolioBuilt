        </li>

    </ul>

        What you need to do:

        Identify a number of Narratives that you are well 
        familiar with
        For each narrative engage with (a minimum of) the 
        following questions: 
        </p>
        <p>
        
        - Why is it interesting to you?
    </p>
    <h4>
        look below, not a lot of writing, but way over the time limit
    </h4>

        <p> 
        - What is the 'data' in this narrative? - 
        </p>
        <h4>
        The data I would say based off what i did below is the visuals. 
        I was originally going to talk about music but I just spent so much time on what I did below that 
        it makes sense to say that what you visually see on your screen is data
        and that data creates an experience unlike the real world.     
        </h4>
        <p>
            
        How does the form (i.e. the platform / media / interface)
        impact your experience of the narrative? 
        </p>
        <h4>
            the form impacts your experience alot because it is interactive.
            It is alot more then just a movie because you can actually emerse yourself
            in the experience.
        </h4>
        <p>
        Would it be 
        better/worse in a different form? - If the original 
        creator were to re-tell the narrative today,
        how would you want them to do it? What could they do 
        to make it better for you?
    </p>
    <h4>
        I think it would be worse in any form besides VR. Being able to 
        explore new worlds by physically walking through them 
        would be amazing. I really hope VR continues to grow into that space
        where we can be fully invested into a digital atmosphere. However, 
        if the someone was to retell the narrative today I think it would 
        be super cool if they did a TV show. And you might say to me "Hey 
        isn't there already a TV show" and my answer to that would be Yes, but
        but it is the farthest thing from what the game actually is about.
        I think one of the most interesting things about the game is it's storyline
        so instead of just having cutscenes I think it could really benefit from 
        a retelling of the story with most importantly, the same music. Music is 
        so important in this series that it wouldn't be Halo if Marty wasn't 
        bringing the heat on the piano.
