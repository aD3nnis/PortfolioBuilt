        Reflection 11
    </h1>
     <p>
        In our discussion with Pastor Drew, and talked about how he integrates his understanding of faith with the concept of data. As a pastor his role is to accompany people through the experiences of their lives. What that looks like is resonating with the truth that God is always present and working meaningfully in those moments. The way Drew approaches data is deeply tied to his role as a pastor which is work that is about words, their power, and their relational context.

        Drew highlighted how words are the foundation of his ministry, echoing the biblical narrative where God spoke creation into existence. Words, he explained, have transformative potential when they remain tied to relationships and are used to shape behavior and understanding. If they are abstracted away from relationship, they risk losing their power. This resonated with me as I reflected on how I often engage with words in purely informational or theoretical ways. Drew’s perspective made me think more thoughtfully about words and I considered how words and data should inform my actions and interactions with others meaningfully. One of the ideas Drew shared was about storytelling. He pointed out how Jesus often taught through stories rather than straightforward lectures. He also explained that stories plant seeds in our memory and imagination, allowing the truth to take root over time. This approach isn’t just about giving people facts to share. More importantly it’s about helping them wrestle with deeper truths in a way they can internalize and recall when needed. It made me think about how often we demand quick answers in our digital age being a technology-driven world. Yet the most useful form of learning often comes from grappling with stories.

    Drew’s reflections on love was super interesting to me, particularly his take on self-giving love. He described it as loving others in a way that allows them to remain fully themselves, rather than trying to mold them into our image. This kind of love, he explained, is at the core of scripture and is the response God calls us to as we wrestle with His Word. The flexibility of scripture with its capacity to speak into different contexts while remaining anchored in God’s love, parallels how we engage with data today. Like scripture, data is open to interpretation and shaped by our values and perspectives.

    We also explored the role of technology in shaping our engagement with words and relationships. Drew acknowledged both the benefits and challenges technology brings. For example, he shared how technology helped him learn Greek, a task he struggled with previously, yet he also expressed concern about how technology shortens our patience for deeper engagement with words. I found this tension familiar, as I’ve noticed how quickly I lose focus when faced with long texts or stories. Drew’s insight pushed me to consider how I can use technology thoughtfully, ensuring it serves the purpose of fostering deeper relationships and understanding rather than becoming a distraction. Additionally, one of the most interesting parts of our discussion was about artificial intelligence and how that relates to love and relationships. Drew pointed out that while AI is informed by human data, it lacks the mutual self-giving that defines love at its healthiest. Relationships with AI, he suggested, risk reducing love to a transaction rather than a transformative interaction. Yet, he also recognized the potential of technology to reflect the story arc of God’s love if used responsibly.

    Overall, the conversation was great for me to think about. It made me have a deeper appreciation for the connection between data, storytelling, and love in shaping how we live and interact. Drew’s reflections reminded me that at the heart of all these discussions is the call to love that is self-giving, patient, and transformative which reflects God’s presence in our lives. As I navigate my own use of words, technology, and relationships, I hope to carry forward this vision of data as something relational, flexible, and deeply meaningful.
