    <h3>Example of Data</h3>
    <p>
        My mom wrote her dissertation on how teachers show love in the classroom.
         And what she found was “in order to be an effective instructor, 
         love would need to be present in the classroom and that without it, students would most likely do poorly.“
    </p>
    <p> I have more examples of the data. I made a list of quotes I found very interesting or useful to what I was wanting to research.
        Here is a link to the list of quotes I made from my mom's dissertation: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fvGpBFpUG1QMTAe0vVHTMfwkGZ7ZybZy1fQfp838HdE/edit?usp=sharing">

        I went to adobe's AI image generator and I took some of its images like these below
        and here is a link to that AI tool: <a href="https://new.express.adobe.com/generate-image?%24web_only=true&prompt=make+an+image+of+an+old+women+with+big+round+glasses+looking+confused+at+her+phone+with+the+light+glowing+from+her+phone+onto+her+face.+Her+grandchild%2C+a+boy%2C+sits+next+to+her.+He+is+about+14+and+has+square+glasses+on+his+face.+He+is+showing+the+old+women+how+to+use+her+phone"> Adobe AI Image Generator</a>

    </p>
    <div class="image-container">
    <img src="img/older-photo-1.jpeg" alt="">
    <img src="img/older-photo-2.jpeg" alt="">
    <img src="img/older-photo-3.jpeg" alt="">
    <img src="img/grandma-photo.png" alt="">
    </div>
    <h4>How I used those images above</h4>
    <p>
        I basically used the AI generated image for the boy and the grandma but i wanted the second image to be more specific. 
        AI was not able to do exactly what I wanted even though I was very precise with my words.
        I had asked for a medium-close shot of an old man with square glasses looking confused at 
        a hologram in front of him with the light glowing from the hologram onto his face. Next to 
        him on his left is his grandchild, a girl about the age 14 and she is showing him how to use 
        the hologram. The hologram is in the center at the bottom of the image. The girl is either 
        pointing or touching the hologram while the old man watches. The hologram is on the table and 
        the girl is pointing to it. 


    </p>
    <p>
        However, you can see that the girl is only pointing in one of the photos and 
        the AI actually made it so that the old man was poiting. I wanted it show that the girl
        was leading in the activity as if you could grasp from the pitcure the girl knew how to interact
        with the hologram but the grandfather did not. This is where it parallels to the previous image where the
        boy is helping his grandma with her phone. That is something that we can understand as an audience because 
        we are use to seeing that type of interaction. So the boy pointing at the phone was less necesary as
        the girl pointing to the hologram which is something we have not really experienced intereacting with as a society. 
        So this is why I took those three images and combined them with the hologram i liked the most and the girl that 
        was interacting with her body language the most into one image. i also took the arm of the girl who was pointing because
        I needed the girl to be interacting with the hologram.
    </p>
    <p>
        What is interesting to note here is that AI helped me alot with creating these images. I was 
        originally going to sketch out everything myself but then I realized that i was having a hard time
        visuallizing what I wanted to happen. I could describe what i wanted but there were holes in my thinking 
        that I wanted to see fixed so thats when I had the idea to use an AI image generator. However there were alot
        of restrictions with it and that could be because I wasn't paying for it but it also seemed obvious to me in what I 
        was asking made sense so I was puzzled when it would not generate what I was asking. I asked three times
        for it to show me an image of the girl pointing or touching the hologram and it only ever did it once and it got
        worse the more times I asked it. This brings up something interesting that if I knew what was going on behind the 
        scenes and understood how to make better prompts I could have possibly saved myself a couple hours of doing
        my own photoshop. And that is kind of a huge part of what I find interesting when dealing with AI and education is that 
        because I don't know certain things about technology, I take more time to do things. There is an argument to be said that
        the process of you figuring out how to do something is the part of learning that is necessary but I additionally think that you
        can learn also through getting better at choosing prompts to give AI generators. I think we worry that incoporating more technology
        use into our lives in more useful ways will make us more dumb and less creative but I don't see it that way. I think of
        calculators and how that use to be a thing that we now see as something we use in math when that use to be thought of as cheating.
        I think what i see in our future that is important to note is AI should be doing the mondane stuff so that we can do the creative things. 
        AI should be a helper and insight us and spark ideas into our minds. Yes I basically let AI do the creativity of mostly picking the
        images for me but my added text with the images in the same section is what gave those images a new meaning and that is what I think
        we should be supportive of.

        Personal Connection to Data
    </h3>
    <p>
        <b>What are the core elements / data of your craft / lens?</b>
        I think the core elements of my data involve the student teacher relationship and how respect plays a role in that. I also think that my data shows the significance of that relationship and how students can feel less engaged or disconnected in a class. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>How have digital systems impacted your field's work? Or how will they affect your future work? Have they been good/bad/interesting?
        </b>
        Digital systems have impacted my work and I think that is the whole reason I am having this study in the first place. It is because there has been controversy of the use of technology in classrooms due to differentiating opinions on how much tech should be used.  
    </p>
    <p>
        <b> What is one thing you wish technologists better understood about your discipline / lens?</b>
    I think people who are so involved in technology are not necessarily asking how this affects education. Because if you look at how Chatgpt is being used right now, I would say a lot of professors and teachers would be disappointed with all the ways that students use AI to do their assignments. So some funny things I have noticed for this past week is that chatGPT was down and some of my roommates were freaking out because it was helping them do finals for their classes. Here is a link to that thread: 
      </p>
<a href="https://x.com/search?q=chat+gpt+down&ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Esearch" target="_blank"> The link</a>    
<p>After reading the posts, I found them both entertaining and a bit sad. It was eye-opening to see how many students were affected and how much they relied on AI to help them. One of my roommates, who “needed” it for a test, even told us she was mentally preparing to fail because ChatGPT was down. You wouldn’t believe her relief when it came back online a couple of hours later. As she sat there stressed out, I thought to myself, “Should I tell her about Gemini?” It was an interesting conundrum. Do I help her essentially cheat on her assignment by telling her about another large language model, or do I let my close friend fail her test? Objectively, most people would probably say I should let her fail because it was her responsibility to study. However, I think it’s also important to note that she’s at a disadvantage compared to me because I have more knowledge about technology. If I were in her situation where I wanted to cheat, I wouldn’t be worried about ChatGPT going down because I know about other tools like Gemini.
   </p>


   <p>
This highlights a larger issue that non-tech-savvy people are going to get left behind in education as technology continues to advance. This is the crux of the problem—technology is evolving, and you either keep up or get left behind.

</p>
<p>
    Now, back to my main point: does allowing technology in education exacerbate this problem? It’s complicated, and I think we need to keep discussing it. What I fear is that we’ll pretend AI doesn’t exist, and more people will end up like my friend—failing because they weren’t aware of the tech available to them. Yes, in her case, if she had studied properly, she wouldn’t have been so reliant on ChatGPT, which is a good argument against using technology in education. But I’m not talking about now—I’m talking about 10 or 15 years from now when generations who grew up with AI are teaching us things we don’t understand. Sound familiar? Ask your grandparents or parents how they feel about operating systems or smartphone apps.

</p>
<p>
    Tech-savvy people will always be ahead in this way because technology is an everyday tool for everyone. Additionally, the younger generations who grow up using new tech outpacing their parents in knowledge of everyday devices is what creates an imbalance of power and respect. What I think we are seeing in our education currently is a lack of respect for the knowledge our professors or teachers provide. Respect is necessary to build trust and what I can see is that students are trusting the opinion of their search browsers over the opinion of a PhD. And I don’t mean that students find what their professors say to be wrong, maybe more on the lines of unnecessary. If a student figures out the structure of a class early on and they do not like the class they will do what they can to not put effort into it. And that seems obvious but it is important to break down what that could look like. In terms of grades, if the class has presentations that you're supposed to take notes on so you can study for a test then what is the purpose of going to class? If a student can get the presentations online, ask ChatGPT to make notes and a student studies those notes and gets a good grade, does that show the student is actually engaging with the material? I would say no, the student is not doing a good job of being engaged and is probably also cheating by using ChatGPT in doing the assignments. But we are at a point now where a student can passively engage in a class and still get a good grade and that should worry people who care about education. 

</p>
<p>
    Another thing I would like to point out is that in this scenario, this person is not respecting the professor because they are not respecting how the assignment was supposed to be done. They do not trust or care enough to follow along with how the course was designed and therefore cheated because they did not find it valuable. This is an important problem that is not new, and while the technology may be different, the core issue remains the same. Kids have always cheated and will continue to cheat, but what makes AI so much more interesting is that it can essentially do an entire class for you. 

</p>
<p>
    As a culture, we seem to have lost sight of what respect looks like for older generations, partly because of the way technology has reshaped our lives. It has made our grandparents seem obsolete and our professors feel like relics of the past. Why listen to a presentation made by a professor five years ago when I can access the same material online for a fraction of the price? Yet, this is where connection and relationships make all the difference and this is something that my mom found valuable from her our reasearch. I think after reading her dissertaion I was able to see the bigger picture of what really matters in education and why we have instructors at all. While technology can provide an education, it cannot foster the personal growth that comes from challenging oneself alongside others pursuing the same goal. Professors should serve as role models and educational leaders to guide students, helping them avoid the same mistakes they made in high school. And how can professors teach in a tech driven world when policy forbids its use? What scares me is the disadvantage this creates for people who currently live in a society that is revolving around technology but try to pretend it doesn’t innovate. I’m pro-technology, but that doesn’t mean regular people know what they’re doing when they use it. We need to start discussing technology for what it is: a tool that everyone uses and will continue to use throughout their lives. We need to understand how to protect our data and prepare for failures when systems go down. If our educational leaders don’t show us the proper ways to use technology then no wonder students choose unethical ways of using their devices.

</p>
<p>
    Personally, I’ve learned a lot about technology from cryptocurrency in this regard. Not only have I made a decent amount of money from it, but it also taught me the importance of password security and sticking to a plan to prepare for potential failure. In my friend’s case, she kept all her test notes neatly organized on ChatGPT. So, when it went down, she had nothing to rely on and was completely unprepared. She was too dependent on technology and took it for granted.

</p>
<p>
    What she should have done was save her notes locally on her computer so that a website outage or lack of internet access wouldn’t have affected her test preparation. Would this still make her heavily reliant on ChatGPT? Yes, but at least she wouldn’t have taken it for granted. She even could have gone a step further and printed out her notes in case her computer broke entirely. This is what cryptocurrency has taught me. I don’t keep my passwords on my computer; they’re written on paper and stored in a vault because I value the security of my assets. Am I still reliant on these platforms not scamming me? Yes, but I’ve limited my risks and benefited from using technology.

</p>
<p>
  Another point I want to address is why students aren’t openly talking about AI. I think many students are using AI but staying silent because we’re told we’re not supposed to use it. It’s like when a parent asks their child, “Why don’t you ever tell us about drinking alcohol when you do it all the time?” If parents punish their kids every time they mention alcohol, it’s no surprise they stop sharing. Similarly, students avoid discussing AI because they fear being ratted out by peers or penalized by educators. It’s almost political at this point. Are you pro AI or do you think it’s a waste of time and everyone who uses it is incompetent. It can get very polarizing and everyone knows you don’t talk about politics in the workplace. 
  
</p>
<p>
    I think the current mentality in education regarding AI is that teachers and professors are hoping it will just go away. But the reality is, AI is only going to get better, faster, and cheaper. It’s time to face this head-on instead of ignoring it. It may be undeniable that we will end up like the grandpa staring confused at the hologram while his granddaughter shows him how it works. But what we can change today is learning how to make technology easier to understand and more accessible to everyone so we don’t get these huge generational divides that lead to a lack of respect for the knowledge of the older generations. We can have discussions today within our education systems that ask the question "should we innovate" and "how can we get ahead in tech in ethically good ways". I’m not saying everyone needs to be a computer science major but everyone should understand that innovation is happening through technology and everyone will be affected by it. We need to be open about what is happening in the tech world and how technology is seeping its way into so many different areas of expertise like psychology, economics, and history. It makes you wish there was a class that taught you about the effects of technology in all these different disciplines...

    <b> How are you engaging with your vocation in this work?</b>
    Well for one thing, I hope to always be apart of the conversation in how technology will affect my life. 
    And so I guess my calling is related to this because I think what is important to me is allowing a space for exploration with technology.
    I have always liked technology but I used to be very restricted from using it. As a kid my dad would punish me for playing video games too long. 
    Does it make sense for him to do that? Yes it makes sense to tell your kids to touch grass every once in a while but what hurt is that it was a gender thing. I think
    he didn't like the idea of me being invested in "boy activies" that he didn't find useful. So there are alot of things as far as my hobbies that I 
    don't talk about with him because I know he looks down on it. I don't talk video games and I don't talk anime with him which is partially a generational thing
    but more importantly it's a cultural shift. I think kids today don't trust the opinion of their parents or teachers because they
    walk into classrooms that disallow technology and tell them that they will be removed from class if they check their phones. And then they get home
    to grumpy parents who tell them to stop playing nonsensical games and go do something better with their lives. There is a bunch to unpack here but I come
    from the perspective of giving technology a place in education and more focusing on what that looks like. I think when we approach conflict with an invitation
    for the other perspective and a welcoming, caring manner, we will gain more respect and have deeper conversations. Thats what I want to continue
    to bring to the table.
