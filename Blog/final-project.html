    <h3>Example of Data</h3>
    <p>
        My mom wrote her dissertation on how teachers show love in the classroom.
         And what she found was “in order to be an effective instructor, 
         love would need to be present in the classroom and that without it, students would most likely do poorly.“

        image I created and my process into this
    </p>
    <div class="container-final-img">
        <img src="img/photoshopped-ai-image.png" alt="" class="final-img">
    </div>
    <p> 
        I went to adobe's AI image generator and I took some of its images like these below

    </p>
    <div class="image-container">
    <img src="img/older-photo-1.jpeg" alt="">
    <img src="img/older-photo-2.jpeg" alt="">
    <img src="img/older-photo-3.jpeg" alt="">
    <img src="img/grandma-photo.png" alt="">
    </div>
    <h4>How I used those images above</h4>
    <p>
        I basically used the AI generated image for the boy and the grandma but i wanted the second image to be more specific. 
        AI was not able to do exactly what I wanted even though I was very precise with my words.
        I had asked for a medium-close shot of an old man with square glasses looking confused at 
        a hologram in front of him with the light glowing from the hologram onto his face. Next to 
        him on his left is his grandchild, a girl about the age 14 and she is showing him how to use 
        the hologram. The hologram is in the center at the bottom of the image. The girl is either 
        pointing or touching the hologram while the old man watches. The hologram is on the table and 
        the girl is pointing to it. 


    </p>
    <p>
        However, you can see that the girl is only pointing in one of the photos and 
        the AI actually made it so that the old man was poiting. I wanted it show that the girl
        was leading in the activity as if you could grasp from the pitcure the girl knew how to interact
        with the hologram but the grandfather did not. This is where it parallels to the previous image where the
        boy is helping his grandma with her phone. That is something that we can understand as an audience because 
        we are use to seeing that type of interaction. So the boy pointing at the phone was less necesary as
        the girl pointing to the hologram which is something we have not really experienced intereacting with as a society. 
        So this is why I took those three images and combined them with the hologram i liked the most and the girl that 
        was interacting with her body language the most into one image. i also took the arm of the girl who was pointing because
        I needed the girl to be interacting with the hologram.
    </p>
    <p>
        What is interesting to note here is that AI helped me alot with creating these images. I was 
        originally going to sketch out everything myself but then I realized that i was having a hard time
        visuallizing what I wanted to happen. I could describe what i wanted but there were holes in my thinking 
        that I wanted to see fixed so thats when I had the idea to use an AI image generator. However there were alot
        of restrictions with it and that could be because I wasn't paying for it but it also seemed obvious to me in what I 
        was asking made sense so I was puzzled when it would not generate what I was asking. I asked three times
        for it to show me an image of the girl pointing or touching the hologram and it only ever did it once and it got
        worse the more times I asked it. This brings up something interesting that if I knew what was going on behind the 
        scenes and understood how to make better prompts I could have possibly saved myself a couple hours of doing
        my own photoshop. And that is kind of a huge part of what I find interesting when dealing with AI and education is that 
        because I don't know certain things about technology, I take more time to do things. There is an argument to be said that
        the process of you figuring out how to do something is the part of learning that is necessary but I additionally think that you
        can learn also through getting better at choosing prompts to give AI generators. I think we worry that incoporating more technology
        use into our lives in more useful ways will make us more dumb and less creative but I don't see it that way. I think of
        calculators and how that use to be a thing that we now see as something we use in math when that use to be thought of as cheating.
        I think what i see in our future that is important to note is AI should be doing the mondane stuff so that we can do the creative things. 
        AI should be a helper and insight us and spark ideas into our minds. Yes I basically let AI do the creativity of mostly picking the
        images for me but my added text with the images in the same section is what gave those images a new meaning and that is what I think
        we should be supportive of.

        Personal Connection to Data

        <b>What are the core elements / data of your craft / lens?</b>
        I think the core elements of my data involve the student teacher relationship and how respect plays a role in that. I also think that my data shows the significance of that relationship and how students can feel less engaged or disconnected in a class. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>How have digital systems impacted your field's work? Or how will they affect your future work? Have they been good/bad/interesting?
        </b>
        Digital systems have impacted my work and I think that is the whole reason I am having this study in the first place. It is because there has been controversy of the use of technology in classrooms due to differentiating opinions on how much tech should be used.  
    </p>
    <p>
        <b> What is one thing you wish technologists better understood about your discipline / lens?</b>
        I think people who are so involved in technology are not necessarily asking how this affects education. Because if you look at how Chatgpt is being used right now, I would say a lot of professors and teachers would be disappointed with all the ways that students use AI to do their assignments. So some funny things I have noticed for this past week is that chatGPT was down and some of my roommates were freaking out because it was helping them do finals for their classes. Here is a link to that thread: 
<a href="https://x.com/search?q=chat+gpt+down&ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Esearch"> The link</a>    
After reading the posts I could see how they were both very fun and also very sad. You can see how many students were affected by it and put all of their hope into AI helping them. Even sitting across from my roommate who “needed” it for a test told us that she was mentally preparing herself to fail for the test because Chat gpt was down. You would not believe her relief when it came back online a couple hours later. However I thought to myself as she was sitting there stressed out, “should I tell her about Gemini?”. This was an interesting conundrum. Do I help her basically cheat on her assignment by telling her about another large language model or do I let my close friend fail her test again. I think most people would say objectively you should let her fail because it was her fault she did not study properly but I think what is also important to note is that she is at a disadvantage compared to me because I have more knowledge in technology. I know about Gemini so if I was to do what she was doing I would not be worried about ChatGPT going down and that gets at an interesting problem where we can already see glimpses of non-techy people being left behind in education. This is the crux of the issue which is technology is advancing and you are either with it or you get left behind. 
So back to my main argument of allowing technology in the classroom; does allowing tech in education influence the problem I addressed above. It’s complicated and I think we need to keep talking about it. What I am afraid of is we just pretend AI does not exist and we all end up like my friend, failing because we were not aware of tech being available. And yes as of right now if she would have studied she wouldn’t have been worried which is an argument against technology. But I am not talking about right now, I am talking 10, 15 years from now when generations who grew up using AI are teaching us things we don’t understand. Sound familiar? Ask your grandparents or parents how they feel about their operating systems and applications on their smartphones. 

The tech people will always be ahead in this way. I have no doubts the CS faculty who are older will understand technology to the same extent younger generations do but they are not the vulnerable population in this scenario. This is what scares me for my friends and family. I am pro using technology but that doesn’t mean that regular people know what the heck they are doing when they use it. I think we need to start talking about technology for what it is, a tool that everyone uses and will continue to use their entire lives. We need to understand how to protect our data so that we can be prepared when things do shut down. I honestly think crypto has been really good for me in this case.
Not only have I made a good amount of money from it but I have learned about the importance of password security and being serious about sticking to a plan to prepare for failure. So in my friend's case she kept all her notes she was going to use for her test neatly organized on chat gpt so when it went down she had nothing to go off of and had no preparation for failure. She was too reliant on that technology and took it for granted. I think what we have to understand is that we are all reliant on technology which is another issue but what i think the bigger problem is that we take it for granted. What she should have done was copy it all onto her computer locally so the website being down or not having an internet connection would not affect her taking the test. Does this still make her very reliable on chatgpt, yes but she did not take it for granted. She would be smart and maybe even to take it a step further could have printed out her notes in case her computer broke entirely. This is what crypto has taught me. For my passwords I do not have them on my computer. They are on a piece of paper in a vault because I care about the security of my assets. Am I still highly reliant on these platforms not scamming me behind the scene, yes but in return I have limited my risk with fraud and was able to profit from using technology. 
Another point that I would like to add is that there has been talk about why students are not talking about AI. Well I think a lot of students are using AI but not talking about it because we are told we are not supposed to use AI. When a parent asks their child “why do you never talk to us about you drinking alcohol when you do it all the time” a parent should not be surprised by this if they choose to punish their kids every time their child thinks about using alcohol. And the children don’t want to be ratted out by their peers so they just keep those secrets close to their friends which is why it seems like no one is talking about it.
 I think the mentally in education currently with AI is that teachers and professors are kind of hoping that it just goes away but the reality is that it is only getting better, faster, and cheaper.
