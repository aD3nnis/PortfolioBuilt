    Reflecting on the discussion with the philosophy professor Rebekah, I was interested in the way she intertwines her roles as both a philosopher and a park ranger. It’s fascinating how she bridges these very different worlds, focusing on helping people understand the importance of both philosophical things in the environment. She also finds joy in connecting with others, whether that’s guiding students through difficult philosophical questions or educating park visitors about nature. One part of her story that resonated with me was her reflection on educational goals. She emphasized that education is not just about acquiring job skills, but about learning how to live as a successful human being. I was particularly interested in what she said about her academic experience that her wish that someone had given her time to reflect on this idea earlier in her life. It made me think about the pressures we often face growing up which revolve around the issue to pursue certain careers like being a doctor or lawyer, especially as a woman, where fields like computer science aren’t always pushed as much.

        What I also found out is that her interest for on the question about her concerns about the shift in education, particularly regarding the core classes being taken away. She misses having core in education, but remains hopeful about where it’s headed. It made me wonder about the role of an education in general and how important it is to be exposed to different ways of thinking before diving deep into one career or subject. Philosophy, she explained, is about evaluating arguments and seeing how they connect. I can see why this skill set is so valuable, not just in philosophical discourse but in life because of how it teaches us to ask better questions, challenge assumptions, and make well-informed decisions. Another interest of hers that I found out about was network epistemology, which explores how information flows through communities. Her research with landscape models, where a computer attempts to "climb a peak" to find the best answer, struck me because it reminded me of AI. The less connected a system, the faster it tends to reach the best answer which is weird.

        The intersection of philosophy and AI also caught my attention. She pointed out that while AI can do things like code or debug, it struggles with logic which is a core component of philosophical thinking. This raises important questions about the glittering advances of technology and the hidden losses they bring. Are we, as she asked, losing our humanity in the process? She used an example from Google’s Gemini, where AI is used to write messages that people might send to their friends, highlighting how technology could distance us from each other. It made me think more critically about how we integrate technology into our lives, and whether we should slow down to consider the broader implications.

       Finally, I appreciated how she strives to make her philosophy classes fun. She talked about using games like logic jeopardy and applying philosophical ideas to active scenarios, like conspiracy theories. Her sense of humor and creativity in teaching made me realize that philosophy doesn’t have to be intimidating or overly abstract; it can be engaging, playful, and deeply relevant to our everyday lives.

       In the end, this conversation left me reflecting on the bigger picture which is how philosophy can help us navigate life’s complexities, challenge the pressures of a fast-paced, capitalist world, and foster more thoughtful, human-centered ways of living and learning.
