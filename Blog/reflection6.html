        Reflection 6

        Reflecting on Bran’s visit to our digital humanities class, I found it inspiring to see how he combines his classical music background with computer science to explore the intersection of music, technology, and data. His journey from a piano performance major with little tech experience to designing custom synthesizers and studying algorithms demonstrates a unique path where traditional music education meets modern computational tools. It’s clear that he sees music not just as an art form but as something fundamentally compatible with technology, opening up new methods of expression.

        A notable part of his work involves ray-casting and circuit design for music assemblies, which introduces an engineering aspect to composition. It’s intriguing how his custom synthesizer and use of MIDI for audio interfaces mirror the way writers type into word processors, making music composition an interactive digital experience. The practical applications of these skills enable him to create tools that “democratize music,” much like software democratizes writing and visual art. This perspective highlights his belief that these digital tools don’t necessarily replace live performance but offer an alternative that expands access to musical creation.

        His concerns over the “digital dark age,” where music and literature are often pirated, underscore the economic impact of digital accessibility on artists. He mentioned Napster as a prime example of how technology enables content theft, creating challenges for musicians who depend on their art to make a living. Yet, he also acknowledged the positive side of digital tools, which allow more people to compose and experiment with music. This democratization aligns with his approach in encouraging students to start with pen and paper, grounding their creativity in traditional methods before moving to digital platforms like MuseScore.

        Bran’s approach to composition through algorithms and AI further underscores his innovative blend of art and technology. His use of AI in synthesizing music in a specific example where the AI analyzes physical attributes of instruments rather than simply playing back samples demonstrates how technology can enhance music production without replacing the unique nuances of live performance. His passion for these tools is balanced with a respect for live music, which he believes has irreplaceable qualities that recordings or synthesized versions can’t fully replicate.

        Ultimately, Bran’s perspective emphasizes that algorithms and music technology aren’t “better or worse, just different.” He believes music in visual media should be subtle and support the emotion of the visuals, underscoring his view that music, in any form, is powerful because of its therapeutic and emotional significance. For Bran, music is not only a form of expression but also a means to invoke emotions and connect deeply with audiences, whether through live performances or digital compositions. His presentation reminded me of the expansive possibilities that digital tools bring to music, offering fresh avenues for creativity while preserving the essence of musical expression.
