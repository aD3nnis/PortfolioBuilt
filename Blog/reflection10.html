    Dr. Kevin Grieves’ presentation in our digital humanities class shed light on the evolving role of data in journalism, urging us to critically assess data and understand its implications on news credibility. His discussion emphasized that journalism and data are intricately linked, and both play an essential role in shaping informed societies. Journalism is about collecting, accessing, assessing, and presenting data in ways that allow the public to understand complex issues, from politics to natural disasters. This mission becomes even more critical in a digital world flooded with information, where clear and accurate reporting is crucial to navigate an abundance of data. Dr. Grieves challenged us to consider journalism from multiple perspectives, especially regarding objectivity, subjectivity, and the ethical dimensions of data sourcing. His comparison of journalism to the scientific method was particularly compelling, as it highlights the structured, investigative nature of quality journalism. Just as a scientist carefully gathers and assesses data, journalists must also scrutinize sources and methods before presenting information. Sources like government agencies, public opinion surveys, FOIA requests, and even data scraping or leaks each come with unique ethical and reliability concerns. This process is essential to build trust, which is foundational to journalism’s role in society.

Additionally, the importance of transparency also stood out in his talk. Dr. Grieves stressed that every data-driven assertion in journalism should be reproducible and transparently sourced.  It should enabling audiences to verify claims independently. This approach could combat the erosion of trust in news which is a significant concern in an era where misinformation spreads quickly. He pointed to tools like averages and correlations, showing how journalists should handle these concepts responsibly to avoid misleading the audience. For instance, adjustments in a graph's y-axis can alter the perception of data, underscoring the importance of full disclosure to the audience. Also, the notion that journalism itself is storytelling is something is super important to know. It reinforced that news is not just about relaying facts but about making them relatable and understandable, balancing what is both interesting and important. Dr. Grieves also raised thought-provoking questions about whether it’s the journalist's role to educate audiences on statistical topics like correlation versus causation or data reliability. I believe that as news consumers, we benefit when journalists help us grasp these foundational concepts, ultimately equipping us to be more discerning about the information we encounter daily.

However, reflecting on the trustworthiness of journalism, it’s clear that the digital age has seen both gains and losses. While traditional news sources are often seen as reliable, the shift towards social media and online news aggregators has introduced issues around credibility, given the lack of rigorous fact-checking on many of these platforms. However, we have also gained new avenues for accessible and real-time information, making it crucial to balance skepticism with openness to new formats. One thing that I think about in this space is Twitter or X being a source of information for people. Dr. Grieves’ suggestion to seek transparency and understand sources deeply is a reminder to approach all news with a critical lens, regardless of its platform even if it is social media.

In sum, Dr. Grieves’ presentation highlighted the nuanced relationship between data, journalism, and trust. His insights on storytelling, transparency, and critical thinking provide a solid framework for evaluating news sources and understanding the ethical responsibilities of journalists. Going forward, I’m more aware of the importance of not just accessing information but critically assessing and contextualizing it to navigate today’s complex media landscape.
