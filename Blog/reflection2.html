        Reflection 2:
    </h1>
    <p>
    My reflection is based of what Jessica Clemens spoke about friday
    </p>
    <p>
            The discussion on technology in education reveals diverse perspectives 
        on its impact and utility. Jessicia Clemens from the English department, focuses 
        on rhetoric and composition.
        She says that digital media studies are increasingly relevant. Historically, rhetoric 
        dates back to around 600 BC, while composition as a formal discipline 
        began to evolve in the 1960s. The field has grown to encompass multimodal 
        approachesâ€”incorporating not just traditional text but also 
        visual, oral, and auditory elements. This shift highlights the benefits 
        of combining various modes of expression beyond the conventional essay 
        format, which is often mistakenly viewed as a single-mode medium. Additionally 
        the concept of multimodal expression emphasizes the richness of combining 
        different modes, which enhance communication and comprehension. 
        She is also the writing center director, so
        recognizing that expression is not limited to traditional models is crucial.
        Her view challenges the standard norms of text, encouraging 
        exploration beyond formats like Word documents.

        Next she talks on digital humanities, which began with early in the 1960s. 
        The focus now is on leveraging digital tools to address 
        digital problems, acknowledging that technology has always been a part of 
        writing and cultural expression. "Digital natives," those who have grown 
        up surrounded by technology, are particularly more use to these tools. 
        One thing Dr. Clemens like to think about in this space is "critical AI literacy," 
        which is essential in an age where technology shapes communication and learning.

        However, the debate over whether physical or digital writing is superior is not a good debate. 
        In her eyes context plays a significant role. Each has their own advantages. I prefer digital writing 
        for organization but some argue that physical writing 
        offers a richer sensory experience. Although it is important to remember that assistive 
        technologies also need to be part of this conversation to ensure equitable
        access for all students.

        One of I think the highlights of what Dr. Clemens talked about was that there 
        should be no blanket 
        bans on technology. This is so disadvantagous to learners who want to grow
        in a space that we use every day. Dr. Clemens leas towards 
        supporting technology use, especially when it addresses specific support needs.
        This is why she stresses her digital literacy class and having discussions about 
        technology's role in education.
        We should help aim to equip students with critical skills and navigate digital spaces more
        effectively.

        Another important part she brought up was that when we think of technology 
        we think of the newest thing. 
        The impact of digital systems extends beyond the latest gadgets. Historical 
        technologies, like typewriters, were once revolutionary, and writing itself 
        has always been a form of technology. This perspective challenges how older
        generations view this new digital space as something we should ignore. We 
        should learn how to grow in this space in healthy practices rather then 
        treat it as unecessary.

        Lastly, a question I asked her had to do with the 
        value of video game communities. In the context of video games, 
        understanding their importance involves 
        recognizing them as part of discourse communities, similar to academia.
        Video games foster unique communities and critical play, challenging 
        the notion that writing and other intellectual activities must be
        inherently difficult or exclusive. 
        What I think is important to note is that the stigma surrounding digital 
        writing and gaming is diminishing. What should happen is we should offer
        a more participation in these fields. This overall I think is the point. 
        Technology and digital media have transformed education and 
        communication. We can use its tools to broaden access and enrich the ways 
        we express and interact with content. And I think that is a beautiful thing.
