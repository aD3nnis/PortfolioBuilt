    <h1>
        Reflection 3
    </h1>
<p>
    I was not able to be physically present for the presentations during class
    Which makes me want to talk about a specific point before
    i get into reflecting on these two presentations.
    </p>
    <p>
    I found out the other day that I have the Flu, I have never had the Flu
    before but I woke up one morning and I was so lathargic and exhausted
    that I could not will myself out of bed until the late afternoon. And it
    is funny when I did eventually went to the health center and the nurse told me
    that I shouldn't go to class and I said "well what if the mark me down points
    for not showing up?". And her response was "They should understand". But for
    one of my professors, when I emailed him that I was sick with the Flu
    He very quickly put in the gradebook that I had missed class. And so in his class I 
    have a B- because it is the only grade in the gradebook. And for me it's like
    "whats the alternative? I show up and get everybody sick?" In addition to this, I 
    have another professor with another policy that he has 4 random in class assignments 
    he makes his students do for attendance and I saw that it was possible I was missing the 
    one day I would need to be in class for participation because I had the Flu. So i 
    drove to his office hours and asked if I missed the assignment. And i told him i wasn't feeling 
    well and he seemed so shocked that I was there and kept his distance. And that just doesn't
    make any sense to me, why keep your distance if the only way I will get credit for class is showing up
    even if that means showing up sick and contagious.
    These policies make no sense to me. This doesn't happen in the workforce ever, why do we force students to 
    come to class when they are super sick or make them feel bad by taking points from them when they would
    rather respect the health of the students around them. It is such a loose loose situation and it makes 
    me not enjoy the classes that I am in because it makes me feel like I am not respected as an adult
    who is aware of how they feel and what is best for them

    Back to the presentations, I found that both touched on how technology shapes 
    different aspects of our lives—whether it’s about 
    how we store our data or how we navigate choices 
    and behaviors influenced by free will and social media.
    <p>
    The first presentation focused on data storage, 
    something that we all need in our devices. 
    He highlighted the different ways we store our data, 
    from older forms like CDs and DVDs to more modern storage 
    solutions like SSDs and USB drives. SSDs, in particular, 
    stood out to me because of how they use flash memory to erase
    and rewrite data at the bit level which is hard to explain. 
    It is fascinating 
    how much faster and more reliable they are compared to 
    older technologies. Yet, despite all the advances, 
    it is true how fragile storage still is. 
    Phones can be dropped, and data can disappear in an instant which 
    was talked about in the presentation. 
    I realized that while it’s easy to take data storage for granted, 
    we really need to be proactive about backing up important information.
    I work on this personally with backing up important photos onto a hard drive
    that I can plug into my computer. I didnt know that there was 
    a profession of people called archivalists and there
    role is preserving data which is a wild thing to think about.
    Seeing how important it is to safeguard information should
    help people realize the importance of their own data and
    what they choose to do with it.

    The second presentation was much more philosophical. It got into
    the concepts of free will, luck, and how technology, especially 
    social media, influences our daily decisions. I was interested in 
    the video shown that had a study that shows how the brain preps 
    us for actions
    before we’re even consciously aware of them. I think this is one 
    of those things that really 
    challenges the idea of free will. It makes me wonder how 
    much control I really have over my choices and maybe it means i have more
    control because my brain can stop my actions. I could hear in 
    the video that this point 
    sparked a larger conversation about religion, especially 
    the idea of free will in the story of Adam and Eve, and 
    whether our actions are truly our own if something or 
    someone (like God) already knows the outcome.

    The second part of his presentation was a discussion on social media 
    which I think is always important for our time.
    In general I noticed how personalized all of my
    friend groups social media feeds are and it is one of the reasons
    I got rid of mine. 
    And it’s eerie to think about how algorithms are constantly 
    adjusting what I see to keep me engaged when i do look at social media. 
    Hearing that some 
    people equate social media to dangerous tools, like an AR-15, 
    really emphasized how powerful and potentially harmful it can be. However 
    I think that analogy is a little extreme becaise AR-15 were built to kill
    I think social media was not made for the same purpose. But
    the idea that we’re spending hours a day scrolling without 
    realizing it does show how deeply social media is embedded in our 
    lives. It’s clear that we need to find a balance, especially 
    younger generations who are growing up fully immersed in these digital spaces.
    </p>
    <p>
    In reflecting on both presentations, I see a common theme of
    technology that has an immense influence on us, whether it’s in the 
    background silently storing our data or actively shaping our
    behaviors and decisions. Data storage feels like a technical 
    problem we all need to particpate in if we want to use technology long term, 
    but when it 
    comes to free will and social media, the lines between control 
    and influence become much more complicated. Both topics lead me to think on
    how much of my life is shaped by technology and sometimes 
    in ways I don’t even notice. It’s a reminder for me to be more mindful. It is
    also a reminder that I control what data I store and I should be
    aware of the tech that gets shoved in my face from the world.
