        John Pell

    During class, John Pell, the Interim Provost at Whitworth, shared his perspective on education, and it was one of those talks that makes you rethink things in education because of his thought-provoking ideas. He didn’t try to dazzle or talk up the school, since he is supposed to make it seem great; instead, he invited us to consider education, especially in the liberal arts, as a tool for navigating the complexity of both knowledge and human experience. One of his comparisons stood out to me: he described data as a language rather than something tangible. At first, it seemed like a strange analogy, but as he explained it, the idea clicked. Like language, data is about interpretation and context. it’s a way of communicating and is not a definitive answer. This reframing made me think about how often we treat data as if it’s unquestionable, forgetting that its value depends on how we use and understand it. Liberal arts education, Pell suggested, helps us see those connections, preparing us to approach problems with flexibility and creativity. I appreciated that perspective and it made a lot of sense to me.

    Pell’s thoughts on soft skills like things such as asking meaningful questions and connecting with others also caught my attention. He pointed out how undervalued these skills are, especially in technical fields where hard skills often dominate the conversation. But as he explained, it’s the soft skills that bridge the gap between a great idea and its impact in the real world. His take on rhetoric as something technologists should understand was particularly interesting. It highlighted how even the most advanced systems exist in a social context, influencing behaviors and shaping lives. That connection between technology and humanity is easy to overlook but so important.

    Another idea that stuck with me was his critique of speed in education. When the question on speed and education got brought up, Pell talked about how we often equate quick learning with intelligence, which can overshadow the value of deeper, slower engagement. As someone who sometimes feels that pressure to process things quickly, I found his perspective refreshing. He emphasized creating space to reflect and practice rather than constantly rushing to consume more content, and that approach felt both practical and meaningful. What I appreciated most about his talk, though, was the way he addressed the limits of data. While acknowledging its power, he reminded us that data can’t fully capture human complexity. It shows patterns but doesn’t account for the exceptions and often what I find is those exceptions are what matter most. His focus on critical thinking as a skill to cultivate, rather than something innate, felt particularly relevant. It was a reminder to resist binary thinking and instead engage with nuance and context, which is especially important in today’s polarized world.

    Looking back, what stood out about Pell’s perspective was his grounded, balanced view of education. He didn’t position it as a solution to every problem, but as a way to better understand the complexities of life. Liberal arts education, in his view, isn’t about memorizing facts or chasing the “right” answers. It’s about learning how to think in diverse, adaptable ways that help us engage meaningfully with the world. His talk didn’t feel like a call to action, exactly, but more like a quiet nudge or even just a reminder of what education can be when we let it be more than just a means to an end.
